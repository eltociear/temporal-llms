1,blog1.TE3input.tml,IS e2 BEFORE e3,Was the thinking before the getting to the checkout?,yes,"So i went to ikea last night. Talk about consumerism. I spent $165, and i'm sort of kicking myself. It's one of those things where you walk along and put stuff in the cart, thinking, 'oh that is a good deal' or 'i should buy this for xxx'. Then when you get to the checkout, it's $165.87 and you go 'how did that happen?' i don't know. I will admit i like to shop, but i am torn about consumerism. It's bad. and that directly conflicts with my affinity for shopping. hm. What to do? I don't know. Keep shopping? This whole website thing is my attempt to jump on the bandwagon. I'm just following suit -- many of my friends have already done this. So i feel like sort of a copy cat. But it's fun anyway. Well, i have to go check on dinner. It's cooking (and probably burning) as i write this. I set off the smoke alarm the other night. I would like to think i'm domestic, but not really. I guess domesticity takes effort which i'm not willing to make. Adieu till later."

9,blog2.TE3input.tml,IS e4 BEFORE e5,Did they get married before they moved to Maine?,yes,"Well. I started this blog years ago and never kept up with it. In fact, I sort of forgot about it. Now, I am done with school and married and I actually have *time* on my hands! (Gasp! Imagine that!) And, I really want to get back into the swing of writing, so I thought blogging might be a good way to start. I feel like an introduction is in order, so here's a bit about me. My name is Kathleen. I am 22 years old, and I live in Portland, Maine with my husband Brett. We are originally from Portland, Oregon but lived in Seattle for 4 years during college. I work as an office manager in a small software company, so I tend to have a bit of time on my hands. Hence, the blogging. I'll probably talk a lot about all of the changes that have happened in my life in the past year, since that's what is on my mind right now: getting married in July, moving to Maine in November, changing jobs several times, etc. So I will get right down to it. I am pretty freaking grumpy today. Well, to be honest, I've been really grumpy for a few weeks and I can't seem to get un -grumpy, which I hate. Feeling out of control, especially of myself, is not something I like. I guess I'm coming to realize that life, and especially marriage, is NOT easy. Maybe I assumed that since we dated for over 4 years before we got married, that things would be easy. Everyone says that the first year of marriage is the hardest, and for the first six months I laughed that off. ""Hard?"" I would scoff. ""No way! I love being married. It's wonderful! It's amazing! blah, blah, blah."" Now it's like the crap has hit the fan and I am transformed into a grumpy, nagging, mean, yelling wife. Ugh. I don't want to be like this but every time I resolve to be different I fall right back into it. Choosing your battles is a lot harder than it seems. I think that's a lot of what I'm learning; that I really do have to choose my battles, because if I pick on every little thing, he won't listen at all when the big things come along and I really need him to listen. Heh. That's my psychological epiphany for the day."

I got to see a lot of people I don't normally hang out with which was great. I took my mom out for Mother's Day. We went into Manhattan and saw ""Movin' Out"", the Billy Joel musical. It was actually really, REALLY good! Then my brother treated her and I to Ruth's Chris steaks for dinner. That was extremely yum. It was so cute because at the end of the night she started crying and thanking us for ""the best mother's day ever"". It was tres cute. I'm thinking of getting an apartment about 20 mins away from where I live now with my best friend from high school. I dunno how it will work out, but we're both employed full time and we've lived together before, so hopefully it wont be that bad. Plus we would have the cutest, best, most awesome apartment. Woo hoo to that. I'm also stoked because I get to do a focus group. Its like only an hour and its about facial cleansers and they're gonna pay me $50. Suhweet! She also told me she would keep me on the list and call me when she needed people. W00t, w00tarini! Oh, I also got new emo/ashleigh banfield glasses. Yay!"

27,blog4.TE3input.tml,IS e1 BEFORE e3,Did UPS leave a slip before she stayed home?,yes,"UPS came yesterday and left a slip stating that they attempted to deliver a package which required a signature. It said DKNY. I figured it was my watch. I left work early, too! We probably just missed them by a few minutes. Brian was saying that if he would have come home straight from work, instead of taking me to lunch, he could have been home to accept the package. Darn it. The slip did state that a second attempt would be made the following day, Friday (today). I stayed home from work even though I could not afford it, to ensure that I would be home to accept my package. They came a little earlier than stated, but I was thrilled to finally have it. I saw it in the catalog two weeks ago and just had to have it. Actually a lot of people at work are going on shopping sprees because after our call center closes on May 17th and everyone is laid off, we won't be able to avail of our 30% merchandise discount any longer."

35,blog5.TE3input.tml,IS e2 BEFORE e3,Did someone pump gas before she headed to the premiere?,yes,"Oh for the love of God, please end this day, this work week... It's bad enough when I find a transaction on my bank statement that I didn't make, but it's worse when I report it to the bank that they fail to tell me they'll be cancelling my card. So depositing two checks , and getting money for the weekend didn't happen this morning. Apparently someone pumped $35 worth of gas at some gas station in North Hollywood on a Monday during the workday. My car can only hold $20 worth of gas when the gas prices are sky high, I was at work that Monday, and I don't ever go to North Hollywood. It's creepy, as I have no idea how someone could've gotten my info. Hopefully it was just a computer glitch on WaMu's part. Mom's latest tip on keeping your credit/debit card number safe : When signing your receipts at a restaurant, be sure to take your copy, but also scratch out your credit card number on the restaurant's copy before leaving it on the table. Your card has already been run through the computer, and there's no use for it after that. Thanks Mom! I'm headed to the premiere of the Coen Brothers' ""Intolerable Cruelty"" tomorrow night. It's also a wrap party for their latest film remake which finished today, ""The Ladykillers,"" starring Tom Hanks. My friend Jenny (another IU alum) who works on all the Brothers Coen films invited me, so it should be a rip roarin' good time. The dress is Hollywood casual, and I still have no clue what that means. I've lived out here for over a year now, and I think I can still count the number of clothes I've purchased on two hands... maybe even one. I'd really love to see Hanks and Clooney in the flesh, and maybe casually elbow Catherine Zeta in the boob. That, or I could show her my stylin' T-Mobile phone. Never really been that big a fan of hers. Hopefully this will be a good networking night for me, as I'm out of work around Halloween time. :( Treasure your steady jobs, kids."
39,blog6.TE3input.tml,IS e1 BEFORE e2,Did they come along to chill before babysitting?,yes,"It's been a crazy week here at work, but luckily my weekends keep me sane enough to stay in this game called ""Ladder Climb in Hollywood"". Last weekend was packed full of fun things. My Aunt Deirdre from Boston is in town on a photo shoot, and my Uncle Pete and 7-month-old cousin Aidan came along to chill for the week. I'm babysitting him on Sunday, so I'm hoping all of my big sister/diaper changing/bottle warming techniques come back. Pete, Aidan, and I strolled over to the Santa Monica Pier where Red Bull was holding their annual Flugtag event. A gazillion people were there watching these groups of people launch their weirdly engineered contraptions off the Pier in hopes that it'll fly. Most designs were top-heavy and immediately nosedived into the Pacific. Still fun to watch though. I also went with some friends to ""The Animation Show"" at the Regent Theatre in Hollywood. So much of animation seems filmic these days! It showcased a lot of Mike Judge and Don Hertzfeldt's older work. Don's ""Rejected"" is still my fave. Very funny. It's coming to a theatre near you. I've been getting some good use out of my longboard lately. It is by far the best leg and ab workout I've had in a long time. AND it has helped my balance and posture tremendously."

46,blog7.TE3input.tml,IS e12 BEFORE e13,Is the told Alison before the put it up on the site?,yes,"I told Alison this story earlier in the week and she asked me to put it up on the site. It is about a weirdo of a little boy that was coming to the education program at my work. His name, which could be the best part here, is Gockberk. He is from Turkey. And, mind you, he is not a cute Gockberk. The kid has a freakishly huge head and he NEVER stops crying. One day, I was roped into holding him after he had been crying for maybe 30 minutes. I noticed that the poor Gock was dressed in a onesie (the baby underwear that snaps down below), corduroy pants, a heavy dress shirt, and a woolen vest in an 85 degree room. He was all sweaty and uncomfortable looking, so I took off his vest. He stopped crying almost immediately. Just when I was beginning to have some fondness for his large Turkish cranium, his mom came in the room and basically bitched me out in Turkish for removing the precious vest. Well! Poor Gocky had to wear the thing for the rest of the day and pretty much cried for the remainder of the day. None of the kids like him because he never shuts up and he is the only Turkish one in the group. After that, he only came back once and I think his mom requested that I not be allowed to watch him. I just like his name. Also, there is this crazy show on the WB called urlLink The BeastMaster . Matt and I were watching it this weekend when there was nothing else on tv. It made us laugh but it was really some Tarzan-esque type of show. Check out the site -- this guy is a real hottie!"

57,blog8.TE3input.tml,IS t0 BEFORE t1,Is the document time stamp before Saturday?,yes,Tick Tock... Well I'm pretty much all set for this Saturday's exam...at least that's how I see it...

I decided to entertain her 'visions'...but then again she's the one who introduced us in the first place... So I think if we really hook up in the end then she'll see that her match-making venture did bear fruit in the end... I've one more day to go before I fully get the books out of my way... Remember I do not open my textbooks on exam eve... Maybe I'll sneak a peak tomorrow...it's Thursday...just to clarify some of the things that have yet to be fully understood... Of course I have some doubts about my study and pre-exam rituals...but then again there's always the case of the pre-exam jitters setting in... Well as I always say... Whateva Floats Your Boat...

4,blog1.TE3input.tml,IS e4 AFTER e6,Was the check on dinner after she wrote this?,yes,"So i went to ikea last night. Talk about consumerism. I spent $165, and i'm sort of kicking myself. It's one of those things where you walk along and put stuff in the cart, thinking, 'oh that is a good deal' or 'i should buy this for xxx'. Then when you get to the checkout, it's $165.87 and you go 'how did that happen?' i don't know. I will admit i like to shop, but i am torn about consumerism. It's bad. and that directly conflicts with my affinity for shopping. hm. What to do? I don't know. Keep shopping? This whole website thing is my attempt to jump on the bandwagon. I'm just following suit -- many of my friends have already done this. So i feel like sort of a copy cat. But it's fun anyway. Well, i have to go check on dinner. It's cooking (and probably burning) as i write this. I set off the smoke alarm the other night. I would like to think i'm domestic, but not really. I guess domesticity takes effort which i'm not willing to make. Adieu till later."

8,blog2.TE3input.tml,IS e1 AFTER e2,Did she live in Portland after they lived in Seattle?,yes,"Well. I started this blog years ago and never kept up with it. In fact, I sort of forgot about it. Now, I am done with school and married and I actually have *time* on my hands! (Gasp! Imagine that!) And, I really want to get back into the swing of writing, so I thought blogging might be a good way to start. I feel like an introduction is in order, so here's a bit about me. My name is Kathleen. I am 22 years old, and I live in Portland, Maine with my husband Brett. We are originally from Portland, Oregon but lived in Seattle for 4 years during college. I work as an office manager in a small software company, so I tend to have a bit of time on my hands. Hence, the blogging. I'll probably talk a lot about all of the changes that have happened in my life in the past year, since that's what is on my mind right now: getting married in July, moving to Maine in November, changing jobs several times, etc. So I will get right down to it. I am pretty freaking grumpy today. Well, to be honest, I've been really grumpy for a few weeks and I can't seem to get un -grumpy, which I hate. Feeling out of control, especially of myself, is not something I like. I guess I'm coming to realize that life, and especially marriage, is NOT easy. Maybe I assumed that since we dated for over 4 years before we got married, that things would be easy. Everyone says that the first year of marriage is the hardest, and for the first six months I laughed that off. ""Hard?"" I would scoff. ""No way! I love being married. It's wonderful! It's amazing! blah, blah, blah."" Now it's like the crap has hit the fan and I am transformed into a grumpy, nagging, mean, yelling wife. Ugh. I don't want to be like this but every time I resolve to be different I fall right back into it. Choosing your battles is a lot harder than it seems. I think that's a lot of what I'm learning; that I really do have to choose my battles, because if I pick on every little thing, he won't listen at all when the big things come along and I really need him to listen. Heh. That's my psychological epiphany for the day."

21,blog3.TE3input.tml,IS e5 AFTER e6,Is getting an apartment after living together?,yes,"Mindless Mush I had a really great weekend. I got to see a lot of people I don't normally hang out with which was great. I took my mom out for Mother's Day. We went into Manhattan and saw ""Movin' Out"", the Billy Joel musical. It was actually really, REALLY good! Then my brother treated her and I to Ruth's Chris steaks for dinner. That was extremely yum. It was so cute because at the end of the night she started crying and thanking us for ""the best mother's day ever"". It was tres cute. I'm thinking of getting an apartment about 20 mins away from where I live now with my best friend from high school. I dunno how it will work out, but we're both employed full time and we've lived together before, so hopefully it wont be that bad. Plus we would have the cutest, best, most awesome apartment. Woo hoo to that. I'm also stoked because I get to do a focus group. Its like only an hour and its about facial cleansers and they're gonna pay me $50. Suhweet! She also told me she would keep me on the list and call me when she needed people. W00t, w00tarini! Oh, I also got new emo/ashleigh banfield glasses. Yay!"
24,blog4.TE3input.tml,IS t0 AFTER e1,Is the document time stamp after UPS left a slip?,yes,"UPS came yesterday and left a slip stating that they attempted to deliver a package which required a signature. It said DKNY. I figured it was my watch. I left work early, too! We probably just missed them by a few minutes. Brian was saying that if he would have come home straight from work, instead of taking me to lunch, he could have been home to accept the package. Darn it. The slip did state that a second attempt would be made the following day, Friday (today). I stayed home from work even though I could not afford it, to ensure that I would be home to accept my package. They came a little earlier than stated, but I was thrilled to finally have it. I saw it in the catalog two weeks ago and just had to have it. Actually a lot of people at work are going on shopping sprees because after our call center closes on May 17th and everyone is laid off, we won't be able to avail of our 30% merchandise discount any longer."

34,blog5.TE3input.tml,IS e1 AFTER e2,Did the report happen after the gas was pumped?,yes,"Oh for the love of God, please end this day, this work week... It's bad enough when I find a transaction on my bank statement that I didn't make, but it's worse when I report it to the bank that they fail to tell me they'll be cancelling my card. So depositing two checks , and getting money for the weekend didn't happen this morning. Apparently someone pumped $35 worth of gas at some gas station in North Hollywood on a Monday during the workday. My car can only hold $20 worth of gas when the gas prices are sky high, I was at work that Monday, and I don't ever go to North Hollywood. It's creepy, as I have no idea how someone could've gotten my info. Hopefully it was just a computer glitch on WaMu's part. Mom's latest tip on keeping your credit/debit card number safe : When signing your receipts at a restaurant, be sure to take your copy, but also scratch out your credit card number on the restaurant's copy before leaving it on the table. Your card has already been run through the computer, and there's no use for it after that. Thanks Mom! I'm headed to the premiere of the Coen Brothers' ""Intolerable Cruelty"" tomorrow night. It's also a wrap party for their latest film remake which finished today, ""The Ladykillers,"" starring Tom Hanks. My friend Jenny (another IU alum) who works on all the Brothers Coen films invited me, so it should be a rip roarin' good time. The dress is Hollywood casual, and I still have no clue what that means. I've lived out here for over a year now, and I think I can still count the number of clothes I've purchased on two hands... maybe even one. I'd really love to see Hanks and Clooney in the flesh, and maybe casually elbow Catherine Zeta in the boob. That, or I could show her my stylin' T-Mobile phone. Never really been that big a fan of hers. Hopefully this will be a good networking night for me, as I'm out of work around Halloween time. :( Treasure your steady jobs, kids."

45,blog6.TE3input.tml,IS e2 AFTER e7,Is the babysitting after the went with some friends?,yes,"It's been a crazy week here at work, but luckily my weekends keep me sane enough to stay in this game called ""Ladder Climb in Hollywood"". Last weekend was packed full of fun things. My Aunt Deirdre from Boston is in town on a photo shoot, and my Uncle Pete and 7-month-old cousin Aidan came along to chill for the week. I'm babysitting him on Sunday, so I'm hoping all of my big sister/diaper changing/bottle warming techniques come back. Pete, Aidan, and I strolled over to the Santa Monica Pier where Red Bull was holding their annual Flugtag event. A gazillion people were there watching these groups of people launch their weirdly engineered contraptions off the Pier in hopes that it'll fly. Most designs were top-heavy and immediately nosedived into the Pacific. Still fun to watch though. I also went with some friends to ""The Animation Show"" at the Regent Theatre in Hollywood. So much of animation seems filmic these days! It showcased a lot of Mike Judge and Don Hertzfeldt's older work. Don's ""Rejected"" is still my fave. Very funny. It's coming to a theatre near you. I've been getting some good use out of my longboard lately. It is by far the best leg and ab workout I've had in a long time. AND it has helped my balance and posture tremendously."
