(YES),yes,"BC-Hungary-Astronaut First and only Hungarian astronaut moving to the United States   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP)_ Tired of being sidelined, Hungarian astronaut Bertalan Farkas is leaving for the United States to start a new career, he said Saturday. ``Being 48 is too early to be retired,'' a fit-looking Farkas said on state TV's morning talk show. With American astronaut Jon McBride, Farkas set up an American-Hungarian joint venture called Orion 1980, manufacturing space-travel related technology. Farkas will move to the company's U.S. headquarters. Farkas, an air force captain, was sent into space on board the Soyuz 36 on May 26, 1980. He spent six days aboard the Salyut 6 spacecraft with three Soviet astronauts, Valery Kubasov, Leonid Popov and Valery Riumin. McBride, 54, of Lewisburg, West Virginia, was part of a seven-member crew aboard the Orbiter Challenger in October 1984 and later served as assistant administrator for congressional relations for NASA. Farkas expressed the hope he one day follow in the footsteps of fellow astronaut John Glenn, who at 77 is about to go into space again. On May 22, 1995, Farkas was made a brigadier general, and the following year he was appointed military attache at the Hungarian embassy in Washington. However, cited by District of Columbia traffic police in December for driving under the influence of alcohol, Farkas was ordered home and retired.

33,APW19980219.0476.tml,IS ei14 BEFORE ei2,Was Howes abducted before the commander sent a team to recover the remains of the mine removal expert? (YES),yes,"BC-Cambodia-Britain-Hostage Cambodian resistance general looking for remains of missing Briton UR By DON PATHAN QC UR Associated Press Writer QC   O'SMACH, Cambodia (AP)_ The top commander of a Cambodian resistance force said Thursday he has sent a team to recover the remains of a British mine removal expert kidnapped and presumed killed by Khmer Rouge guerrillas almost two years ago. Gen. Nhek Bunchhay, a loyalist of ousted Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, said in an interview with The Associated Press at his hilltop headquarters that he hopes to recover the remains of Christopher Howes within the next two weeks. Howes had been working for the Britain-based Mines Advisory Group when he was abducted with his Cambodian interpreter Houn Hourth in March 1996. There were many conflicting accounts of his fate. Howes' team was clearing mines 17 kilometers (10 miles) from Angkor Wat, the fabled 11th century temple that is Cambodia's main tourist attraction, when it was attacked. In January this year, British police officers who had been searching for Howes concluded he had probably been killed soon after being captured. The Foreign Office said it had informed the family of Howes, 37 years old when he was kidnapped, that he probably died within weeks or months of his capture on March 26, 1996. ``Obviously, it is deeply discouraging for the family after 22 months, but there is no proof of life. But there is no evidence in either direction _ that there is proof of life or death,'' said a Foreign Office spokesman, speaking with customary anonymity. ``We will continue to do everything we can to establish what has happened.'' Thai military officials who monitor Cambodian affairs said privately Thursday that Britain, through its embassies in Thailand and Cambodia, has been pushing hard to resolve the Howes case as the second anniversary of his abduction nears. Nhek Bunchhay, who had been closely involved in the search for Howes before having to flee the Cambodian capital after a coup d'etat last year, appeared confident he would find Howes' remains. He said he received information from Khmer Rouge guerrillas on where the body had been buried, and recently ordered 10 of his men from a force of 500 near Khmer Rouge headquarters in Anlong Veng to conduct the search. If and when the remains are found, he said, they would be turned over to the British Embassy, apparently meaning they would be sent across the border into Thailand and onward to Bangkok. Nhek Bunchhay said he now believed Howes had been killed within a week of his capture by a Khmer Rouge faction loyal to Pol Pot, then the guerrilla group's leader. Pol Pot is considered responsible for the radical policies that led to the deaths of as many as 1.7 million Cambodians when the communist group held power in the late 1970s. At the time Howes was captured, the Khmer Rouge were a more or less united guerrilla force with more than 10,000 men under arms. But the group began to fall apart in mid-1996 after the defection of one of its top leaders, Ieng Sary. Other commanders, and thousands of guerrillas, followed him. A small hardcore group under Pol Pot continued to hold out at their headquarters at Anlong Veng in northern Cambodia near the Thai border. But in June last year, the remaining leadership had a falling out, and Pol Pot was arrested. In July last year in Phnom Penh, Cambodia's capital, Second Prime Minister Hun Sen staged a successful coup d'etat against First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh. Ranariddh's loyalists, including Nhek Bunchhay, his top military commander, went into hiding or fled the capital. Nhek Bunchhay, evading an intensive manhunt, made his way to O'Smach, the last major outpost held by Ranariddh's forces. His men have held the stronghold _ which is on the border just opposite the Thai province of Surin _ against repeated intense attacks by Hun Sen's troops. They have been aided by Khmer Rouge guerrillas from Anlong Veng, who have formed an alliance with Ranariddh's resistance forces to oppose Hun Sen.

Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said that terrorist bombings this month of U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, ``show that terrorism is an indiscriminate killer of innocent people.''  Retaliating 13 days after the deadly embassy bombings in East Africa, U.S. forces Thursday launched cruise missile strikes against alleged terrorist camps in Afghanistan and a chemical plant in Sudan.  ``Countries have the right to defend themselves and their citizens against terrorism and New Zealand appreciates and understands the steps the United States has taken,'' McKinnon said.  The embassy bombings, on Aug. 7, killed 247 people in Kenya and 10 in Tanzania. More than 5,500 people were injured, mostly Kenyans.  McKinnon's spokeswoman said the United States had ``very good intelligence'' linking the sites struck overnight with the embassy attacks.

(AP) --  An abortion foe who is the subject of an international manhunt was charged with murder Thursday in the slaying of a doctor who was cut down in his kitchen by a sniper's bullet.  Federal and state arrest warrants were issued for James C. Kopp, 44, of St. Albans, Vt. His whereabouts are unknown.  ``We have probable cause to believe this man, James Kopp, is responsible for the death of Dr. Barnett Slepian,'' FBI agent Bernard Tolbert said.  Investigators have been searching for Kopp since shortly after the Oct. 23 slaying. Up until Thursday, however, they had described him only as a material witness wanted for questioning -- not a suspect.  In addition to a state charge of murder, Kopp faces a federal charge of violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act by using deadly force against an abortion doctor. Both charges carry up to life in prison. The federal charge also carries a fine of up to $250,000.  The newly filed charges will intensify the ongoing international manhunt, Tolbert said.  In response to the new charges, Canadian officials confirmed that Kopp is a suspect in sniper shootings that injured abortion doctors in November in Vancouver, British Columbia; Winnipeg, Manitoba; and Hamilton, Ontario.  Investigators would not divulge the evidence against Kopp but said last month's discovery of a scope-equipped rifle buried near the Slepian home represented a major breakthrough. Slepian, 52, was shot with a rifle.  Authorities have said they believe the weapon may have been buried in advance of the shooting, with the killer digging it up to fire the shot, then reburying it and fleeing.  Kopp also has been linked, through DNA testing, to a strand of hair found near where the sniper fired, law enforcement sources have said.  Nicknamed the ``Atomic Dog'' in anti-abortion circles, Kopp had been arrested in several states since 1990 for protesting abortion. His car was spotted in Slepian's suburban Amherst neighborhood in the weeks before the shooting, and was found abandoned at New Jersey's Newark International Airport in December, investigators said.  Kopp's stepmother, who married Kopp's father when Kopp was in his 30s, said Thursday from her home in Irving, Texas: ``I would like to see him come forward and clear his name if he's not guilty, and if he's guilty, to contact a priest and make his amends with society, face what he did.''  Kopp is now the second anti-abortion activist being sought by the FBI as a suspect in a fatal attack.  Eric Rudolph has been on the run since the January 1998 bombing of a Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic that killed an off-duty police officer and maimed a nurse.

(YES),yes,"Cuban Mothers Seek Elian's Return By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer    HAVANA (AP) --  The grandmother of Elian Gonzalez said she is willing to go to Miami to bring the six-year-old boy home to Cuba, while Fidel Castro's point man on U.S. relations expressed impatience at Washington's failure to enforce a repatriation order.  In a massive demonstration demanding Elian's return, tens of thousands of Cuban women -- hundreds visibly pregnant and others carrying small children -- marched along Havana's seaside boulevard on Friday to the U.S. mission, waving Cuban flags and chanting ``Bring back our son!''  Elian's young stepmother, Nelsy, flanked by his two grandmothers, was at the head of the ``March of the Combatant Mothers,'' pushing his half-brother in a stroller. Cuban authorities estimated that 100,000 women participated in the march.  The protest marked a return to the larger demonstrations of early December, when hundreds of thousands of people rallied in some of Cuba's biggest gatherings since the triumph of the revolution that brought President Castro to power 41 years ago.  Elian, the boy at the center of the international dispute, was found clinging to an inner tube Nov. 25 off the coast of Florida after his mother, stepfather and others died in a failed attempt to reach U.S. shores. He has been staying with relatives in Miami who do not want to send him back to Cuba.  The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service had ruled that Elian must be returned to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and set Friday as the deadline for his repatriation to Cuba.  But this week, Attorney General Janet Reno lifted the deadline to give Elian's relatives in Miami a chance to fight in federal court to keep the boy with them.  Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly and Castro's point man on U.S.-Cuban relations, told The Associated Press that Cuban authorities are frustrated by Reno's failure to set a new deadline and the INS's failure to enforce its decision.  ``No enforcement action was ever announced by the INS,'' he said.  Alarcon, former Cuban ambassador to the United Nations, dismissed suggestions by some U.S. politicians and Elian's relatives in Miami that Elian's father travel from Cardenas, Cuba, to Miami to pick up the boy. He said Cuba has not prohibited Gonzalez from going to Miami to retrieve Elian, American attorneys -- and even American officials -- have counseled against it.  ``We have gotten the same message from U.S. officials -- in private -- several times that it is not advisable for this man to appear in U.S. territory,'' said Alarcon.  The concern in Cuba always has been that if Gonzalez goes he will immediately become involved in political and legal problems that will prevent his speedy return.  Elian's paternal grandmother, Mariela, told reporters that she was willing to go to Miami to retrieve her grandson if it was assured to her that she could pick him up and return immediately to Cuba without become embroiled in legal or political problems.  ``I would go there just for one minute to get him. To get him. Nothing more,'' she said.  Since his sea rescue, Elian has been increasingly referred to in Cuba as ``our son,'' a boy hero symbolizing the government's decades-long ideological battle with Cuban exiles in Miami. Rather than a clash between two governments, the dispute over Elian is a battle between Cubans of differing political views living on both sides of the Florida Straits.  Reno allowed the extension of the deadline after rejecting a Florida state court order that Elian remain in Miami until March 6 to hear arguments by his American relatives. Reno said the state court had no jurisdiction in the case, but that the Miami relatives should be able to make their case in federal court.  Elian's paternal great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, is fighting to keep the boy with him in Miami, saying he can give the child a better life outside Cuba.

''I am talking about three days'' more or less, Castro told hundreds of university students from across Latin American and the Caribbean in town for a regional congress. ''It is inevitable.''  ''The battle of Elian has been won -- in judicial terms, in legal terms, in political terms,'' Castro said as he wound up his speech at Havana's Karl Marx Theater.  Castro's statement came less than an hour after Gregory Craig, attorney for Elian's father Juan Miguel Gonzalez, announced in Washington that the father would be traveling to the United States Thursday with his wife, their 6-month-old son, and with Fernando Remirez, chief of the Cuban Interests Section in Washington.  ''This courageous father will leave at 4 in the morning (4 a.m. EDT Thursday),'' Castro said. ''And I, at least, will be there to see him off.''  He said the group would be met on arriving in Washington by Craig and Joan Brown Campbell of the National Council of Churches, who traveled with Craig on his lightning trip to Havana on Wednesday.  The Cuban leader said that the U.S. government still did not know how it would transfer Elian to his father, but that it would happen quickly.  The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service said earlier this week that once Gonzalez arrives in the United States it will begin the process to transfer Elian to his custody from the Miami relatives who have been caring for him since he was rescued off the coast of Florida in late November.  The Miami kin has been battling to keep him in the United States, saying it can give him a better life off the communist island. But Gonzalez, backed by Castro, has demanded his rights as Elian's sole surviving parent and insisted that the child be returned to him.  Elian's mother perished along with 10 others when their boat sank during the crossing from Cuba to the United States. Since the tragedy, Elian has become a political poster boy for Cubans with diametrically opposed ideologies living on both sides of the Florida Straits.  During his speech Wednesday night, Castro expressed irritation that much of the rest of the delegation was not granted visas to travel to the United States to stay with Elian while waiting out a federal appeal filed by Elian's Miami relatives and assist in his ''rehabilitation.''  ''More important than the doctors are those 12 children'' from Elian's first-grade class in Cuba, Castro said.  Cuba had asked for 28 visas for the trip, for Elian's father, his stepmother, his little half-brother, a 5th grade boy cousin, the dozen classmates, and a host of teachers, doctors and other specialists.  Also on the list was National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon, who has served as adviser to Gonzalez over the past four months and a senior member of Cuba's communist leadership.

Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling 212-556-4204.) LR QL UR (JT LR ) QL UR By RICHARD W. STEVENSON LR QC QL UR c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service LR QC QL   WASHINGTON _ The economy created jobs at a surprisingly robust pace in January, the government reported on Friday, evidence that America's economic stamina has withstood any disruptions caused so far by the financial tumult in Asia. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said the economy added 358,000 jobs last month, far above the 235,000 forecast by economists. It was the third consecutive month that job generation has been exceptionally strong. With growing opportunities for work drawing more people into the labor force, the unemployment rate remained at 4.7 percent last month, just a notch above its quarter-century low. The demand for workers also led employers to raise wages again last month. Average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees rose 4 cents, to $12.51. The gain left wages 3.8 percent higher than a year earlier, extending a trend that has given back to workers some of the earning power they lost to inflation in the last decade. But economists said the wage increase was not enough to raise any concerns about higher inflation. And because the Federal Reserve has made clear that it expects the economy to slow in coming months as ripple effects from Asia reach the United States, investors disregarded the large jobs gains, betting that neither a rise in interest rates nor resurgent inflation is looming. Stocks rose, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up 72.24 points, to 8,189.49, leaving the index within 70 points of its record high set on Aug. 6. In the bond market, a sensitive barometer of inflation anxiety, prices edged up, pushing down the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond to 5.92 percent from 5.93 percent. ``Job creation is sturdy and we have effective price stability,'' said Paul McCulley, an economist at UBS Securities. ``The bottom line is that we've got a lovely economy.'' With potential inflation counterbalanced by worries about possible price declines, the Fed and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, have suggested that they intend to keep interest rates unchanged until the economy tilts clearly in one direction or another. The job figures for January extended a surge in employment gains that began last fall, just when the labor market had showed signs of cooling. After accounting for a small downward revision Friday to December's figures, the economy has been creating jobs at a rate of 358,000 a month for the last four months _ and 381,000 over the last three months _ after averaging 242,000 for the first nine months of 1997. The surge in jobs reflects a remarkable confluence of positive and self-reinforcing economic forces. Inflation has been almost nonexistent, and consumer confidence has been extremely strong. After a short, sharp drop when Asia's financial problems first became clear, the stock market has rebounded and corporate profits have remained healthy. Long-term interest rates, an important indicator of economic stability, have fallen in the last few months. Lower rates have helped invigorate housing and other interest-sensitive sectors of the economy by making loans more affordable, and have allowed companies to continue investing heavily in more efficient equipment. The likelihood that the federal budget will soon move from deficit into surplus has further improved the outlook. The less money the government needs to borrow, the more is freed for private investment. President Clinton welcomed the job figures at a news conference Friday. His advisers said the results reflected not just from balancing the budget, but also initiatives like improved access to education and training and the opening of foreign markets to trade. ``There are enormous economic and social benefits from our nation's high-employment economy,'' said Janet Yellen, the chairwoman of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers. Some of the biggest employment gains came in the construction industry, which added 92,000 jobs in January. The increase reflected the strength of the housing industry, which has been helped not just by declining interest rates but also by unusually warm weather. Service industries also showed solid job gains, as did manufacturers, two areas expected to be hardest hit when the effects of the Asian crisis hit the American economy. The major harm from Asia is likely to come from the plunge in the value of many Asian currencies relative to the dollar, a situation that is expected to lead to a surge of inexpensive imports into the United States, hurting American competitors. And the weakness of the Asian economies is also likely to lead to decreased demand for American exports. ``The economy has been running on the fumes of the strength from before the Asia shock,'' McCulley said. ``Those fumes will exhaust themselves, and the manufacturing sector is going to start getting beat up in the spring.'' The figures showed the unemployment rate for adult men declined to 3.8 percent last month from 4.1 percent in December, the lowest figure for almost two decades. The rate for adult women rose 0.4 percent, to 4.4 percent. For the first time, the Labor Department broke out unemployment by education level as well as gender, age and race. The analysis showed unemployment rates dropped steadily with higher levels of education. Among people with less than a high school education, the rate in January was 7.2 percent. Among high school graduates, the rate was 3.9 percent, and college graduates, 1.9 percent.   NYT-02-06-98 2219EST"

Late Monday, U.S. State Department officials said that travel visas had been approved for Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, his immediate family and three other people _ a pediatrician, a psychologist and one of Elian's favorite cousins. The group might come to the U.S. as soon as Tuesday, according to unconfirmed media reports.  But Miami's volatile Cuban exiles continued to vow they would block any attempt to take Elian from the Little Havana home where he has been living with his Miami relatives, with some predicting bloodshed if federal agents come for the boy.  ``There will be thousands here to stop it if they come for him,'' said Ana Bonnin, one of about 100 exiles who practiced forming a human chain outside the home Monday. ``We'll try to do it peacefully, but you can only do so much. You can't control everybody.''  Late in the day, lawyers for Elian's Miami family emerged from their third day-long meeting with federal officials, but said little.  ``We continue to be very concerned about the mental and psychological well-being of this 6-year-old,'' said Manny Diaz, one of the family's attorneys. ``To that end, we'll be back tomorrow to continue our negotiations.''  Federal officials made no immediate comment.  It was not clear whether the Gonzalez family would come to Miami to get Elian or if instead they would travel to Washington, D.C.  Cuban President Fidel Castro has said they would live in the home of a Cuban diplomat in the Washington area until the court case surrounding Elian's fate is resolved.  Visas for the entourage of more than 20 teachers, classmates and others _ including Ricardo Alarcon, Cuban National Assembly president _ that Castro wants to accompany the family were not yet approved, officials said.  The rush of events caps a four-month ordeal that has seen Elian catapulted into the center an international tug-of-war. He was found floating in an inner-tube off the Florida coast on Thanksgiving Day after a boat carrying him from Cuba sank. His mother and 10 other people drowned.  Federal officials placed him with his Miami relatives, but kept custody over him. In January, Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner ruled that Elian should go back to Cuba, a decision upheld by U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno.  The Miami relatives filed a federal lawsuit to overturn the decision, but in March a Miami federal judge ruled against them. They immediately appealed to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.  Legal experts and federal officials maintain that Reno can allow the boy to be sent back to Cuba before the appeal is heard.  Last week, federal officials sought to have the family must sign an agreement to turn the boy over voluntarily should they lose their appeal. If the family refused, INS had threatened to revoke Elian's parole, meaning federal officials would take him from the Miami family.  The family refused to sign the agreement through two days of negotiations, and INS extended its deadline until 9 a.m. EST Tuesday.  The terms of the talks changed dramatically, however, when Castro announced last Wednesday that the boy's father was ready to travel to the United States. Previously, Gonzalez had said he would never come here to get his son.  Over the weekend, lawyers for the family raised accusations that Juan Miguel Gonzalez had mistreated his son in telephone conversations, saying he had told the boy that his mother was alive and waiting for him in Cuba.  But by Monday, federal officials hardened their negotiating stance, insisting the boy would be turned over to his father once the Cuban group arrives in the United States.  Moves to keep Elian in this country through federal legislation appear to be stymied, as most lawmakers seem to agree the boy should go back to Cuba. A new ABC News-Washington Post opinion poll shows that 6 of 10 Americans also believe the boy should go home with his father.  But in Miami, Cuban exiles insist the majority of Americans don't understand the dynamics of life in Cuba. Just how far they are willing to go to prove their point remains to be seen.  ``If he goes back, he won't be with his real father,'' said Elias Hernandez, who joined the crowd outside the Little Havana home of Elian's Miami relatives. ``His father will be Fidel Castro, the worst dictator in history.''

The British chemical and textile company's plan, which requires shareholder approval, would create a new, listed U.K. stock with a probable market capitalization between #300 million ($473 million) and #400 million, analysts said. The establishment of the separate company, to be called Courtaulds Textiles, could be effective as early as next year's first quarter.  Investors welcomed the move. Courtaulds' shares rose 15 pence to 362 pence, valuing the entire company at about #1.44 billion.  Courtaulds' spinoff reflects pressure on British industry to boost share prices beyond the reach of corporate raiders. Courtaulds' restructuring is among the largest thus far in Britain, though it is dwarfed by B.A.T Industries PLC's plans to spin roughly off #4 billion in assets to help fend off a takeover bid from Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith. The divested Courtaulds textile operations had operating profit of #50 million on #980 million in revenue in the year ended March 31.  Some analysts have said Courtaulds' moves could boost the company's value by 5% to 10%, because the two entities separately will carry a higher price earnings multiple than they did combined. In addition, Courtaulds said the moves are logical because they will allow both the chemicals and textile businesses to focus more closely on core activities.  Courtaulds has been under pressure to enhance shareholder value since takeover speculators -- including Australian financier Kerry Packer -- surfaced holding small stakes last year. Though Mr. Packer has since sold his stake, Courtaulds is moving to keep its institutional shareholders happy. Even without a specific takeover threat, Courtaulds is giving shareholders ""choice and value,"" said Julia Blake, an analyst at London stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd.  In a statement, the company said: ""Both parts can only realize their full potential and be appropriately valued by the market if they are separately quoted companies.

74,WSJ910225-0066.tml,IS ei161 BEFORE t1,Did the president decided that war was necessary before yesterday?,yes,"Breakthrough: U.S. Hails Invasion Of Kuwait and Iraq As `Dramatic Success' --- Troops Meet Little Resistance But Allied Forces Face Political, Military Risks --- Long Columns of Iraqi POWs ---- By Gerald F. Seib Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 02/25/91 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A1 MDEST EUROP FREST EXECUTIVE (EXE) DEFENSE DEPARTMENT (DEF) STATE DEPARTMENT (STD) WASHINGTON -- With the ground battle to liberate Kuwait proceeding with surprising speed and success, Bush administration officials are optimistic the Persian Gulf war can begin winding down in a matter of days. The enormous ground offensive by U.S. Marines and Army troops, at least during its first 24 hours, met only sporadic Iraqi resistance as it quickly penetrated deep into Kuwait and parts of Iraq, military officials said. According to press pool reports, U.S. Marines are already on the outskirts of Kuwait City.   ""So far, the offensive is progressing with dramatic success,"" said a buoyant Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of U.S. forces. Similarly, while cautioning about the uncertainty of early battle reports, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said late yesterday that ""the operation has been very successful."" Amid reports that thousands of Iraqi soldiers had surrendered, administration aides were also upbeat in private, with one even talking of victory within a week. But even continued military success carries political and diplomatic risks for President Bush and the U.S. The allied rejection of the last-minute Soviet-led diplomatic effort to avoid the ground war enabled Mr. Bush to seize the initiative from an Iraq seemingly bent on dictating peace terms. But it has offended some, especially in Arab countries, who now believe that Mr. Bush's real objectives are the demise of Saddam Hussein and the destruction of the Iraqi military, not just the liberation of Kuwait. ""Why have a war?"" asked Abdul Latif Shekar, a customs officer in Egypt, a country participating in the attack on Iraqi troops. ""I think the Gorbachev plan was a good one. Iraq was ready to withdraw."" Now, he says, ""it looks like the West just wants to destroy Iraq."" Despite the early indications of success, the allied forces could still suffer greater casualties and become bogged down militarily, especially when they encounter the tough Republican Guard, which is entrenched along the Iraq-Kuwait border. If so, and if it appears that the American goal actually is to destroy the Iraqi regime even at the cost of badly hurting Iraqi society, ""the lingering cost of that could be high,"" worries former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. But, he notes, ""If everything crumbles totally, that won't be such a problem."" American officials staunchly disavow any interest in driving through Iraq toward Baghdad, either in pursuit of Saddam Hussein himself or to set up some American-controlled government inside Iraq. The Americans say their battle plans call for operating against forces inside Iraq as far north as the city of Basra, about 30 miles north of Kuwait, but say there isn't any plan to drive beyond that. Indeed, French President Francois Mitterrand said yesterday that some allied forces are crossing Iraqi territory as part of a ""pincer"" movement to trap the soldiers occupying Kuwait, but insisted, ""The purpose isn't to invade Iraqi territory, that's not the aim, that isn't the mandate."" Nevertheless, American officials over the weekend became more open in declaring that by destroying Saddam Hussein's military machine they hope to destroy his regime -- a goal likely to be supported by most Americans. In a pre-attack message, Lt. Gen. Walter Boomer, the top Marine in the Persian Gulf, told U.S. Marines that their goal is to "" restore {Kuwait} to its citizens."" He went on to add that ""in so doing you not only return a nation to its people, but you will destroy the war machine of a ruthless dictator."" Secretary of State James Baker said on ABC-TV's ""This Week With David Brinkley"" that the series of United Nations resolutions condemning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait ""imply that the restoration of peace and stability in the Gulf would be a heck of a lot easier if he and that leadership were not in power in Iraq."" Of course, it is still far too early to assume that the military situation on the ground will stay as smooth for allied forces as it appears to have been so far. Iraq still has the potential to cause significant problems by using forces and weapons that don't yet seem fully engaged. For one thing, Iraq still apparently hasn't unleashed its stockpile of chemical weapons. Gen. Schwarzkopf said that some early reports that chemical weapons were used against allied troops turned out to be ""bogus."" Iraq is believed to have the ability to deliver chemical weapons in artillery shells or, perhaps, atop Soviet-made Frog7 missiles. Perhaps more important, it appears that allied troops haven't yet fully engaged Iraq's vaunted Republican Guard, which has been sitting just north of the Iraq-Kuwait border and is considered the most potent element in the Iraqi defense. It remains to be seen how much damage the allied air campaign was able to inflict on the Guard, and whether President Hussein will commit his most valued troops to a fight-to-the-death finish. Certainly Saddam Hussein continues to implore his country to fight on. ""Fight them,"" he urged Iraqis in a radio address. ""All Iraqis, fight them with all the power you have, and all struggle for everything."" American war planners have long assumed that the early stage of the ground attack, in which American forces would use their speed to sweep around Iraqi defenses and their strength to punch through the relatively weak Iraqi front line, would be the easiest part. Despite these early successes, the mere fact that a ground campaign has begun almost guarantees that the Bush administration will face fresh problems growing out of the military situation. There are likely to be additional American prisoners of war taken, and there are signs that President Hussein is taking Kuwaiti hostages. U.S. and Kuwaiti officials say there are reports that large numbers of civilians from Kuwait City are being rounded up and held by Iraqi troops, apparently either for use as human shields or for use later in bargaining once the war is over. President Bush's political argument for going to a ground war has been strengthened by the growing stream of reports of wanton Iraqi destruction inside Kuwait. U.S. officials say that hundreds of Kuwaiti oil wells now may have been set afire. And Robert Gates, Mr. Bush's deputy national security adviser, asserted in an interview on the Cable News Network that Iraqi troops have set fire to ""large sections"" of Kuwait City. Mr. Bush and his aides were leaning toward a military conclusion of the crisis even before the latest reports of Iraqi atrocities in Kuwait came to light. The president and his top aides tentatively decided on Feb. 11 that a ground war would be necessary. The decision was made after Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, returned from a visit with military commanders in Saudi Arabia, administration officials say. Then, a week or so ago, Gen. Schwarzkopf secretly picked Saturday night as the optimal time to start the offensive. The date was unaffected by the last-ditch Soviet peace initiative. The real problem with the Soviet proposals, U.S. officials now say, was that they all would have required lifting economic sanctions against Iraq. The Bush administration considers the sanctions essential to keeping Saddam Hussein under control should he survive the war. Mr. Bush forestalled further diplomatic maneuvering by issuing an ultimatum on behalf of the allies demanding that Iraq withdraw within a week, starting at noon Saturday. Administration aides said that the idea of the ultimatum was Gen. Powell's. He argued setting an explicit deadline for Saddam Hussein to break would, when it was broken, give the U.S. military a clear green light to proceed. In setting out his final challenge to Saddam Hussein, Mr. Bush continued the intensive personal diplomacy he began after the invasion last August. After cabling world leaders about his intention to give Saddam Hussein a final deadline to exit Kuwait, he offered him a week to withdraw fully, instead of the four days he originally considered, because of objections from some European partners that four days seemed punitive and unrealistic. And when he and President Gorbachev spoke about the decision in a talk lasting nearly an hour, the President took pains to listen to what his counterpart had to say, although he already had decided that the Soviet alternative to the allied deadline was unacceptable. Finally, when Iraq failed to respond to the U.S. ultimatum, Mr. Bush let the ground offensive begin as previously planned Saturday night. The attack was lightning quick, as allied forces punched through tall sand berms on the border and pushed forward into Iraq and Kuwait. U.S. Marines were said to have breached troublesome mine fields along the Iraqi lines but Pentagon officials said no amphibious assault on Kuwait's beaches had begun. Long columns of Iraqi prisoners of war could be seen trudging through the desert toward the allied rear. U.S. commanders said 5,500 Iraqi prisoners were taken in the first hours of the ground war, though some military officials later said the total may have climbed above 8,000. The U.S. hopes its troops will drive Iraqi forces out of Kuwait quickly, leaving much of Iraq's offensive military equipment destroyed or abandoned in Kuwait. It expects that tens of thousands of Iraqi soldiers will surrender to the U.S. and its allies over the next few days. If the allies succeed, Saddam Hussein will have plunged his country first into a fruitless eight-year war against Iran and then into a humiliating war against the U.S. and the allies to defend his conquest of Kuwait, leaving much of his country's military establishment and modern infrastructure in ruins. Meanwhile, the U.S. hopes, economic sanctions and an international arms embargo will remain in effect until Iraq pays war reparations to Kuwait to cover war damages. That would undermine any chances of rebuilding either Iraq or its armed forces in short order as long as Saddam Hussein remains in power. The American hope is that someone from within Iraq, perhaps from the army's professional ranks, will step forward and push Saddam Hussein aside so that the country can begin recovering from the disaster. Outside analysts think Saddam Hussein's position is indeed precarious. ""I think frankly Saddam is finished, no matter what happens,"" says Christine Helms, a Middle East scholar who has written extensively about Iraq. ""These guys simply don't retire to condos over the Euphrates."" Despite the lack of any obvious successors, the Iraqi leader's internal power base appeared to be narrowing even before the war began. Some analysts say he appeared to be relying on a smaller and smaller circle of close advisers and relatives. If that's true, the narrowing of his support would make it easier for someone to push him aside from within. Yet, paradoxically, the perception that the U.S. wants to destroy Iraq may increase Saddam Hussein's support within the Iraqi military. And the U.S. now will face sharper questions in the Arab world since it didn't back the peace proposals worked out in Moscow. ""We looked to the United States, we expected you to have the moral edge,"" says Nasser Tahboub, a Jerusalem-born Jordanian who has an American wife and a doctorate in political science from Duke University. ""Now we see that edge eroded. For me, it is a great tragedy. For the first time in history, the U.S. has gone to war with an Arab and Muslim nation, and we know a peaceful solution was in reach."" --- Geraldine Brooks in Amman, Jordan, and Craig Forman in Cairo, Egypt, contributed to this article."

The Bush administration considers the sanctions essential to keeping Saddam Hussein under control should he survive the war. Mr. Bush forestalled further diplomatic maneuvering by issuing an ultimatum on behalf of the allies demanding that Iraq withdraw within a week, starting at noon Saturday. Administration aides said that the idea of the ultimatum was Gen. Powell's. He argued setting an explicit deadline for Saddam Hussein to break would, when it was broken, give the U.S. military a clear green light to proceed. In setting out his final challenge to Saddam Hussein, Mr. Bush continued the intensive personal diplomacy he began after the invasion last August. After cabling world leaders about his intention to give Saddam Hussein a final deadline to exit Kuwait, he offered him a week to withdraw fully, instead of the four days he originally considered, because of objections from some European partners that four days seemed punitive and unrealistic. And when he and President Gorbachev spoke about the decision in a talk lasting nearly an hour, the President took pains to listen to what his counterpart had to say, although he already had decided that the Soviet alternative to the allied deadline was unacceptable. Finally, when Iraq failed to respond to the U.S. ultimatum, Mr. Bush let the ground offensive begin as previously planned Saturday night. The attack was lightning quick, as allied forces punched through tall sand berms on the border and pushed forward into Iraq and Kuwait. U.S. Marines were said to have breached troublesome mine fields along the Iraqi lines but Pentagon officials said no amphibious assault on Kuwait's beaches had begun. Long columns of Iraqi prisoners of war could be seen trudging through the desert toward the allied rear. U.S. commanders said 5,500 Iraqi prisoners were taken in the first hours of the ground war, though some military officials later said the total may have climbed above 8,000. The U.S. hopes its troops will drive Iraqi forces out of Kuwait quickly, leaving much of Iraq's offensive military equipment destroyed or abandoned in Kuwait. It expects that tens of thousands of Iraqi soldiers will surrender to the U.S. and its allies over the next few days. If the allies succeed, Saddam Hussein will have plunged his country first into a fruitless eight-year war against Iran and then into a humiliating war against the U.S. and the allies to defend his conquest of Kuwait, leaving much of his country's military establishment and modern infrastructure in ruins. Meanwhile, the U.S. hopes, economic sanctions and an international arms embargo will remain in effect until Iraq pays war reparations to Kuwait to cover war damages. That would undermine any chances of rebuilding either Iraq or its armed forces in short order as long as Saddam Hussein remains in power. The American hope is that someone from within Iraq, perhaps from the army's professional ranks, will step forward and push Saddam Hussein aside so that the country can begin recovering from the disaster. Outside analysts think Saddam Hussein's position is indeed precarious. ""I think frankly Saddam is finished, no matter what happens,"" says Christine Helms, a Middle East scholar who has written extensively about Iraq. ""These guys simply don't retire to condos over the Euphrates."" Despite the lack of any obvious successors, the Iraqi leader's internal power base appeared to be narrowing even before the war began. Some analysts say he appeared to be relying on a smaller and smaller circle of close advisers and relatives. If that's true, the narrowing of his support would make it easier for someone to push him aside from within. Yet, paradoxically, the perception that the U.S. wants to destroy Iraq may increase Saddam Hussein's support within the Iraqi military. And the U.S. now will face sharper questions in the Arab world since it didn't back the peace proposals worked out in Moscow. ""We looked to the United States, we expected you to have the moral edge,"" says Nasser Tahboub, a Jerusalem-born Jordanian who has an American wife and a doctorate in political science from Duke University. ""Now we see that edge eroded. For me, it is a great tragedy. For the first time in history, the U.S. has gone to war with an Arab and Muslim nation, and we know a peaceful solution was in reach."" --- Geraldine Brooks in Amman, Jordan, and Craig Forman in Cairo, Egypt, contributed to this article."
76,WSJ910225-0066.tml,IS ei8 BEFORE t1,Did the soldiers surrender before yesterday?,yes,"Breakthrough: U.S. Hails Invasion Of Kuwait and Iraq As `Dramatic Success' --- Troops Meet Little Resistance But Allied Forces Face Political, Military Risks --- Long Columns of Iraqi POWs ---- By Gerald F. Seib Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 02/25/91 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A1 MDEST EUROP FREST EXECUTIVE (EXE) DEFENSE DEPARTMENT (DEF) STATE DEPARTMENT (STD) WASHINGTON -- With the ground battle to liberate Kuwait proceeding with surprising speed and success, Bush administration officials are optimistic the Persian Gulf war can begin winding down in a matter of days. The enormous ground offensive by U.S. Marines and Army troops, at least during its first 24 hours, met only sporadic Iraqi resistance as it quickly penetrated deep into Kuwait and parts of Iraq, military officials said. According to press pool reports, U.S. Marines are already on the outskirts of Kuwait City.   ""So far, the offensive is progressing with dramatic success,"" said a buoyant Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of U.S. forces. Similarly, while cautioning about the uncertainty of early battle reports, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said late yesterday that ""the operation has been very successful."" Amid reports that thousands of Iraqi soldiers had surrendered, administration aides were also upbeat in private, with one even talking of victory within a week. But even continued military success carries political and diplomatic risks for President Bush and the U.S. The allied rejection of the last-minute Soviet-led diplomatic effort to avoid the ground war enabled Mr. Bush to seize the initiative from an Iraq seemingly bent on dictating peace terms. But it has offended some, especially in Arab countries, who now believe that Mr. Bush's real objectives are the demise of Saddam Hussein and the destruction of the Iraqi military, not just the liberation of Kuwait. ""Why have a war?"" asked Abdul Latif Shekar, a customs officer in Egypt, a country participating in the attack on Iraqi troops. ""I think the Gorbachev plan was a good one. Iraq was ready to withdraw."" Now, he says, ""it looks like the West just wants to destroy Iraq."" Despite the early indications of success, the allied forces could still suffer greater casualties and become bogged down militarily, especially when they encounter the tough Republican Guard, which is entrenched along the Iraq-Kuwait border. If so, and if it appears that the American goal actually is to destroy the Iraqi regime even at the cost of badly hurting Iraqi society, ""the lingering cost of that could be high,"" worries former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. But, he notes, ""If everything crumbles totally, that won't be such a problem."" American officials staunchly disavow any interest in driving through Iraq toward Baghdad, either in pursuit of Saddam Hussein himself or to set up some American-controlled government inside Iraq. The Americans say their battle plans call for operating against forces inside Iraq as far north as the city of Basra, about 30 miles north of Kuwait, but say there isn't any plan to drive beyond that. Indeed, French President Francois Mitterrand said yesterday that some allied forces are crossing Iraqi territory as part of a ""pincer"" movement to trap the soldiers occupying Kuwait, but insisted, ""The purpose isn't to invade Iraqi territory, that's not the aim, that isn't the mandate."" Nevertheless, American officials over the weekend became more open in declaring that by destroying Saddam Hussein's military machine they hope to destroy his regime -- a goal likely to be supported by most Americans. In a pre-attack message, Lt. Gen. Walter Boomer, the top Marine in the Persian Gulf, told U.S. Marines that their goal is to "" restore {Kuwait} to its citizens."" He went on to add that ""in so doing you not only return a nation to its people, but you will destroy the war machine of a ruthless dictator."" Secretary of State James Baker said on ABC-TV's ""This Week With David Brinkley"" that the series of United Nations resolutions condemning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait ""imply that the restoration of peace and stability in the Gulf would be a heck of a lot easier if he and that leadership were not in power in Iraq."" Of course, it is still far too early to assume that the military situation on the ground will stay as smooth for allied forces as it appears to have been so far. Iraq still has the potential to cause significant problems by using forces and weapons that don't yet seem fully engaged. For one thing, Iraq still apparently hasn't unleashed its stockpile of chemical weapons. Gen. Schwarzkopf said that some early reports that chemical weapons were used against allied troops turned out to be ""bogus."" Iraq is believed to have the ability to deliver chemical weapons in artillery shells or, perhaps, atop Soviet-made Frog7 missiles. Perhaps more important, it appears that allied troops haven't yet fully engaged Iraq's vaunted Republican Guard, which has been sitting just north of the Iraq-Kuwait border and is considered the most potent element in the Iraqi defense. It remains to be seen how much damage the allied air campaign was able to inflict on the Guard, and whether President Hussein will commit his most valued troops to a fight-to-the-death finish. Certainly Saddam Hussein continues to implore his country to fight on. ""Fight them,"" he urged Iraqis in a radio address. ""All Iraqis, fight them with all the power you have, and all struggle for everything."" American war planners have long assumed that the early stage of the ground attack, in which American forces would use their speed to sweep around Iraqi defenses and their strength to punch through the relatively weak Iraqi front line, would be the easiest part. Despite these early successes, the mere fact that a ground campaign has begun almost guarantees that the Bush administration will face fresh problems growing out of the military situation. There are likely to be additional American prisoners of war taken, and there are signs that President Hussein is taking Kuwaiti hostages. U.S. and Kuwaiti officials say there are reports that large numbers of civilians from Kuwait City are being rounded up and held by Iraqi troops, apparently either for use as human shields or for use later in bargaining once the war is over. President Bush's political argument for going to a ground war has been strengthened by the growing stream of reports of wanton Iraqi destruction inside Kuwait. U.S. officials say that hundreds of Kuwaiti oil wells now may have been set afire. And Robert Gates, Mr. Bush's deputy national security adviser, asserted in an interview on the Cable News Network that Iraqi troops have set fire to ""large sections"" of Kuwait City. Mr. Bush and his aides were leaning toward a military conclusion of the crisis even before the latest reports of Iraqi atrocities in Kuwait came to light. The president and his top aides tentatively decided on Feb. 11 that a ground war would be necessary. The decision was made after Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, returned from a visit with military commanders in Saudi Arabia, administration officials say. Then, a week or so ago, Gen. Schwarzkopf secretly picked Saturday night as the optimal time to start the offensive. The date was unaffected by the last-ditch Soviet peace initiative.

Long columns of Iraqi prisoners of war could be seen trudging through the desert toward the allied rear. U.S. commanders said 5,500 Iraqi prisoners were taken in the first hours of the ground war, though some military officials later said the total may have climbed above 8,000. The U.S. hopes its troops will drive Iraqi forces out of Kuwait quickly, leaving much of Iraq's offensive military equipment destroyed or abandoned in Kuwait. It expects that tens of thousands of Iraqi soldiers will surrender to the U.S. and its allies over the next few days. If the allies succeed, Saddam Hussein will have plunged his country first into a fruitless eight-year war against Iran and then into a humiliating war against the U.S. and the allies to defend his conquest of Kuwait, leaving much of his country's military establishment and modern infrastructure in ruins. Meanwhile, the U.S. hopes, economic sanctions and an international arms embargo will remain in effect until Iraq pays war reparations to Kuwait to cover war damages. That would undermine any chances of rebuilding either Iraq or its armed forces in short order as long as Saddam Hussein remains in power. The American hope is that someone from within Iraq, perhaps from the army's professional ranks, will step forward and push Saddam Hussein aside so that the country can begin recovering from the disaster. Outside analysts think Saddam Hussein's position is indeed precarious. ""I think frankly Saddam is finished, no matter what happens,"" says Christine Helms, a Middle East scholar who has written extensively about Iraq. ""These guys simply don't retire to condos over the Euphrates."" Despite the lack of any obvious successors, the Iraqi leader's internal power base appeared to be narrowing even before the war began. Some analysts say he appeared to be relying on a smaller and smaller circle of close advisers and relatives. If that's true, the narrowing of his support would make it easier for someone to push him aside from within. Yet, paradoxically, the perception that the U.S. wants to destroy Iraq may increase Saddam Hussein's support within the Iraqi military. And the U.S. now will face sharper questions in the Arab world since it didn't back the peace proposals worked out in Moscow. ""We looked to the United States, we expected you to have the moral edge,"" says Nasser Tahboub, a Jerusalem-born Jordanian who has an American wife and a doctorate in political science from Duke University. ""Now we see that edge eroded. For me, it is a great tragedy. For the first time in history, the U.S. has gone to war with an Arab and Muslim nation, and we know a peaceful solution was in reach."" --- Geraldine Brooks in Amman, Jordan, and Craig Forman in Cairo, Egypt, contributed to this article."

Times News Service    The FBI has interviewed and released one of two men who were sought last week for questioning in connection with the sniper slaying of a doctor in the Buffalo, N.Y., area who performed abortions.  The two men, Ronald Stauber and Michael Gingrich, were named Thursday in a bulletin sent by the FBI office in Cleveland to police departments across the country. The men were not termed suspects, and FBI officials on Saturday played down the likelihood that either was involved in the Oct. 23 killing of the doctor, Barnett Slepian.  ``We are doing dozens if not hundreds of interviews a day,'' said Paul Moskal, a spokesman for the FBI office in Buffalo. ``I know of no information that would treat these two differently or would put them in any other category from the hundreds of leads we're investigating on a daily basis.''  Moskal said one of the two men _ he said he did not know which one _ had been located, interviewed and released. In its Friday issue, The Hamilton (Ontario) Spectator quoted an officer in the Amherst, N.Y., Police Department as saying that the FBI. bulletin had indicated possible links between the two men and James Charles Kopp, an abortion opponent who is being sought as a material witness in the case. Amherst police officials declined to comment Saturday.  Slepian, 52, an obstetrician and gynecologist, was shot through the kitchen window of his home in Amherst shortly after he and his wife returned home from synagogue on the night of Friday, Oct. 23. He was one of three doctors who performed abortions in the Buffalo area. Investigators in Canada and the United States are also looking into four other sniper attacks on doctors who performed abortions in Canada and western New York.  Moskal said the two men apparently showed up at Slepian's house the day after his death. They were trying to attend a prayer vigil for Slepian but had been sent to his house by mistake, and a police officer on duty took their names, Moskal said. ``They were being sought for interviews just because they were literally in the area after the homicide,'' he said.  FBI officials said they were not certain whether Stauber or Gingrich had been involved in antiabortion activities. The two men are believed to live in the Cleveland area.  Inspector Keith MacCaskill of the Winnipeg Police Service, a Canadian member of a law-enforcement task force investigating all five of the shootings, said he had never heard of the men.

(YES),yes,"1998-08-21 U.S. Air Raid, Bombings No Direct Links: FBI    NAIROBI, August 21 (Xinhua) --  Director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Louis Freeh said here Friday that U.S. air raid on Afghanistan and Sudan is not directly linked with the probe into the August 7 bombings in east Africa.  ""This is an investigation proceeding on many fronts,"" said Freeh at a press conference at the Jomo Kenyatta airport before returning home. ""I cannot detail or characterize the type of evidence we have gathered in Nairobi.""  He said he cannot confirm there is any evidence linking the bomb blasts at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania to the Saudi millionaire and the allegedly main sponsor of anti-U.S. terrorism, Osama Bin Laden, who now lives in Afghanistan.  ""Hundreds of people have been interviewed"" and investigators probably have to take quite a long time to compile evidence in the two bomb blasts so as to reach any conclusion, he said. Freeh flew to Washington immediately after the press conference.  U.S. President Bill Clinton said Thursday that he had ordered the strikes after receiving ""convincing evidence"" that the terrorist facilities the U.S. raided in Sudan and Afghanistan had played key roles in the bomb attacks in capitals of Kenya and Tanzania.  However, Freeh said although the bombing investigators from the FBI, Kenya and Tanzania have been working very hard and made ""very good progress"" on the case, so far no conclusion or decision can be made at this stage.  After touring Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam Thursday and meeting with Kenyan police leaders Friday morning, the FBI chief also said that he is very satisfied with the close and effective cooperation among the FBI agents and the police in Kenya and Tanzania.  The man who hurled a grenade at security guards at the U.S. embassy here seconds before the bomb exploded was positively identified Thursday as two more suspects -- one Arab, one Sudanese -- who had been arrested, Kenya's national newspapers reported Friday.  Local sources said that the plan of bombing U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania took three months to complete and bombers destined for Kenya were dispatched through Somalia and Rwanda.  A senior government official who saw the confessions of suspects was quoted Friday by local media as saying that an Egyptian Islamic Jihad group, linked with Laden, planned the attacks.  The car bomb attack at the U.S. embassy in Nairobi killed 253 people and injured 5,000 others.  A nearly simultaneous car bombing outside the U.S. embassy in Tanzania killed 10 people and wounded about 70 others.

(YES),yes,"1998-08-21 U.S. Air Raid, Bombings No Direct Links: FBI    NAIROBI, August 21 (Xinhua) --  Director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Louis Freeh said here Friday that U.S. air raid on Afghanistan and Sudan is not directly linked with the probe into the August 7 bombings in east Africa.  ""This is an investigation proceeding on many fronts,"" said Freeh at a press conference at the Jomo Kenyatta airport before returning home. ""I cannot detail or characterize the type of evidence we have gathered in Nairobi.""  He said he cannot confirm there is any evidence linking the bomb blasts at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania to the Saudi millionaire and the allegedly main sponsor of anti-U.S. terrorism, Osama Bin Laden, who now lives in Afghanistan.  ""Hundreds of people have been interviewed"" and investigators probably have to take quite a long time to compile evidence in the two bomb blasts so as to reach any conclusion, he said. Freeh flew to Washington immediately after the press conference.  U.S. President Bill Clinton said Thursday that he had ordered the strikes after receiving ""convincing evidence"" that the terrorist facilities the U.S. raided in Sudan and Afghanistan had played key roles in the bomb attacks in capitals of Kenya and Tanzania.  However, Freeh said although the bombing investigators from the FBI, Kenya and Tanzania have been working very hard and made ""very good progress"" on the case, so far no conclusion or decision can be made at this stage.  After touring Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam Thursday and meeting with Kenyan police leaders Friday morning, the FBI chief also said that he is very satisfied with the close and effective cooperation among the FBI agents and the police in Kenya and Tanzania.  The man who hurled a grenade at security guards at the U.S. embassy here seconds before the bomb exploded was positively identified Thursday as two more suspects -- one Arab, one Sudanese -- who had been arrested, Kenya's national newspapers reported Friday.  Local sources said that the plan of bombing U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania took three months to complete and bombers destined for Kenya were dispatched through Somalia and Rwanda.  A senior government official who saw the confessions of suspects was quoted Friday by local media as saying that an Egyptian Islamic Jihad group, linked with Laden, planned the attacks.  The car bomb attack at the U.S. embassy in Nairobi killed 253 people and injured 5,000 others.  A nearly simultaneous car bombing outside the U.S. embassy in Tanzania killed 10 people and wounded about 70 others.  Earlier, the U.S.'s demand for Laden's extradition from Afghanistan has been refused by the Taliban government."

Gen. Nhek Bunchhay, a loyalist of ousted Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, said in an interview with The Associated Press at his hilltop headquarters that he hopes to recover the remains of Christopher Howes within the next two weeks. Howes had been working for the Britain-based Mines Advisory Group when he was abducted with his Cambodian interpreter Houn Hourth in March 1996. There were many conflicting accounts of his fate. Howes' team was clearing mines 17 kilometers (10 miles) from Angkor Wat, the fabled 11th century temple that is Cambodia's main tourist attraction, when it was attacked. In January this year, British police officers who had been searching for Howes concluded he had probably been killed soon after being captured. The Foreign Office said it had informed the family of Howes, 37 years old when he was kidnapped, that he probably died within weeks or months of his capture on March 26, 1996. ``Obviously, it is deeply discouraging for the family after 22 months, but there is no proof of life. But there is no evidence in either direction _ that there is proof of life or death,'' said a Foreign Office spokesman, speaking with customary anonymity. ``We will continue to do everything we can to establish what has happened.'' Thai military officials who monitor Cambodian affairs said privately Thursday that Britain, through its embassies in Thailand and Cambodia, has been pushing hard to resolve the Howes case as the second anniversary of his abduction nears. Nhek Bunchhay, who had been closely involved in the search for Howes before having to flee the Cambodian capital after a coup d'etat last year, appeared confident he would find Howes' remains. He said he received information from Khmer Rouge guerrillas on where the body had been buried, and recently ordered 10 of his men from a force of 500 near Khmer Rouge headquarters in Anlong Veng to conduct the search. If and when the remains are found, he said, they would be turned over to the British Embassy, apparently meaning they would be sent across the border into Thailand and onward to Bangkok. Nhek Bunchhay said he now believed Howes had been killed within a week of his capture by a Khmer Rouge faction loyal to Pol Pot, then the guerrilla group's leader. Pol Pot is considered responsible for the radical policies that led to the deaths of as many as 1.7 million Cambodians when the communist group held power in the late 1970s. At the time Howes was captured, the Khmer Rouge were a more or less united guerrilla force with more than 10,000 men under arms. But the group began to fall apart in mid-1996 after the defection of one of its top leaders, Ieng Sary. Other commanders, and thousands of guerrillas, followed him. A small hardcore group under Pol Pot continued to hold out at their headquarters at Anlong Veng in northern Cambodia near the Thai border. But in June last year, the remaining leadership had a falling out, and Pol Pot was arrested. In July last year in Phnom Penh, Cambodia's capital, Second Prime Minister Hun Sen staged a successful coup d'etat against First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh. Ranariddh's loyalists, including Nhek Bunchhay, his top military commander, went into hiding or fled the capital. Nhek Bunchhay, evading an intensive manhunt, made his way to O'Smach, the last major outpost held by Ranariddh's forces.

(AP) --  An abortion foe who is the subject of an international manhunt was charged with murder Thursday in the slaying of a doctor who was cut down in his kitchen by a sniper's bullet.  Federal and state arrest warrants were issued for James C. Kopp, 44, of St. Albans, Vt. His whereabouts are unknown.  ``We have probable cause to believe this man, James Kopp, is responsible for the death of Dr. Barnett Slepian,'' FBI agent Bernard Tolbert said.  Investigators have been searching for Kopp since shortly after the Oct. 23 slaying. Up until Thursday, however, they had described him only as a material witness wanted for questioning -- not a suspect.  In addition to a state charge of murder, Kopp faces a federal charge of violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act by using deadly force against an abortion doctor. Both charges carry up to life in prison. The federal charge also carries a fine of up to $250,000.  The newly filed charges will intensify the ongoing international manhunt, Tolbert said.  In response to the new charges, Canadian officials confirmed that Kopp is a suspect in sniper shootings that injured abortion doctors in November in Vancouver, British Columbia; Winnipeg, Manitoba; and Hamilton, Ontario.  Investigators would not divulge the evidence against Kopp but said last month's discovery of a scope-equipped rifle buried near the Slepian home represented a major breakthrough. Slepian, 52, was shot with a rifle.  Authorities have said they believe the weapon may have been buried in advance of the shooting, with the killer digging it up to fire the shot, then reburying it and fleeing.  Kopp also has been linked, through DNA testing, to a strand of hair found near where the sniper fired, law enforcement sources have said.  Nicknamed the ``Atomic Dog'' in anti-abortion circles, Kopp had been arrested in several states since 1990 for protesting abortion. His car was spotted in Slepian's suburban Amherst neighborhood in the weeks before the shooting, and was found abandoned at New Jersey's Newark International Airport in December, investigators said.  Kopp's stepmother, who married Kopp's father when Kopp was in his 30s, said Thursday from her home in Irving, Texas: ``I would like to see him come forward and clear his name if he's not guilty, and if he's guilty, to contact a priest and make his amends with society, face what he did.''  Kopp is now the second anti-abortion activist being sought by the FBI as a suspect in a fatal attack.  Eric Rudolph has been on the run since the January 1998 bombing of a Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic that killed an off-duty police officer and maimed a nurse. He also is charged in three Atlanta attacks, including the 1996 Olympic bombing that killed one person."

The protest marked a return to the larger demonstrations of early December, when hundreds of thousands of people rallied in some of Cuba's biggest gatherings since the triumph of the revolution that brought President Castro to power 41 years ago.  Elian, the boy at the center of the international dispute, was found clinging to an inner tube Nov. 25 off the coast of Florida after his mother, stepfather and others died in a failed attempt to reach U.S. shores. He has been staying with relatives in Miami who do not want to send him back to Cuba.  The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service had ruled that Elian must be returned to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and set Friday as the deadline for his repatriation to Cuba.  But this week, Attorney General Janet Reno lifted the deadline to give Elian's relatives in Miami a chance to fight in federal court to keep the boy with them.  Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly and Castro's point man on U.S.-Cuban relations, told The Associated Press that Cuban authorities are frustrated by Reno's failure to set a new deadline and the INS's failure to enforce its decision.  ``No enforcement action was ever announced by the INS,'' he said.  Alarcon, former Cuban ambassador to the United Nations, dismissed suggestions by some U.S. politicians and Elian's relatives in Miami that Elian's father travel from Cardenas, Cuba, to Miami to pick up the boy. He said Cuba has not prohibited Gonzalez from going to Miami to retrieve Elian, American attorneys -- and even American officials -- have counseled against it.  ``We have gotten the same message from U.S. officials -- in private -- several times that it is not advisable for this man to appear in U.S. territory,'' said Alarcon.  The concern in Cuba always has been that if Gonzalez goes he will immediately become involved in political and legal problems that will prevent his speedy return.  Elian's paternal grandmother, Mariela, told reporters that she was willing to go to Miami to retrieve her grandson if it was assured to her that she could pick him up and return immediately to Cuba without become embroiled in legal or political problems.  ``I would go there just for one minute to get him. To get him. Nothing more,'' she said.  Since his sea rescue, Elian has been increasingly referred to in Cuba as ``our son,'' a boy hero symbolizing the government's decades-long ideological battle with Cuban exiles in Miami. Rather than a clash between two governments, the dispute over Elian is a battle between Cubans of differing political views living on both sides of the Florida Straits.  Reno allowed the extension of the deadline after rejecting a Florida state court order that Elian remain in Miami until March 6 to hear arguments by his American relatives. Reno said the state court had no jurisdiction in the case, but that the Miami relatives should be able to make their case in federal court.  Elian's paternal great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, is fighting to keep the boy with him in Miami, saying he can give the child a better life outside Cuba.

''I am talking about three days'' more or less, Castro told hundreds of university students from across Latin American and the Caribbean in town for a regional congress. ''It is inevitable.''  ''The battle of Elian has been won -- in judicial terms, in legal terms, in political terms,'' Castro said as he wound up his speech at Havana's Karl Marx Theater.  Castro's statement came less than an hour after Gregory Craig, attorney for Elian's father Juan Miguel Gonzalez, announced in Washington that the father would be traveling to the United States Thursday with his wife, their 6-month-old son, and with Fernando Remirez, chief of the Cuban Interests Section in Washington.  ''This courageous father will leave at 4 in the morning (4 a.m. EDT Thursday),'' Castro said. ''And I, at least, will be there to see him off.''  He said the group would be met on arriving in Washington by Craig and Joan Brown Campbell of the National Council of Churches, who traveled with Craig on his lightning trip to Havana on Wednesday.  The Cuban leader said that the U.S. government still did not know how it would transfer Elian to his father, but that it would happen quickly.  The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service said earlier this week that once Gonzalez arrives in the United States it will begin the process to transfer Elian to his custody from the Miami relatives who have been caring for him since he was rescued off the coast of Florida in late November.

47,APW20000405.0276.tml,IS ei13 AFTER ei1,Would be Elian's father traveling after Castro's declaration?,yes,"Castro: Elian, Dad To Be Reunited  By ANITA SNOW, Associated Press Writer    HAVANA (AP) --  President Fidel Castro declared Wednesday night that it is just matter of days before Elian Gonzalez will be reunited with his father.  ''I am talking about three days'' more or less, Castro told hundreds of university students from across Latin American and the Caribbean in town for a regional congress. ''It is inevitable.''  ''The battle of Elian has been won -- in judicial terms, in legal terms, in political terms,'' Castro said as he wound up his speech at Havana's Karl Marx Theater.  Castro's statement came less than an hour after Gregory Craig, attorney for Elian's father Juan Miguel Gonzalez, announced in Washington that the father would be traveling to the United States Thursday with his wife, their 6-month-old son, and with Fernando Remirez, chief of the Cuban Interests Section in Washington.  ''This courageous father will leave at 4 in the morning (4 a.m. EDT Thursday),'' Castro said. ''And I, at least, will be there to see him off.''  He said the group would be met on arriving in Washington by Craig and Joan Brown Campbell of the National Council of Churches, who traveled with Craig on his lightning trip to Havana on Wednesday.  The Cuban leader said that the U.S. government still did not know how it would transfer Elian to his father, but that it would happen quickly.  The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service said earlier this week that once Gonzalez arrives in the United States it will begin the process to transfer Elian to his custody from the Miami relatives who have been caring for him since he was rescued off the coast of Florida in late November.  The Miami kin has been battling to keep him in the United States, saying it can give him a better life off the communist island.

Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling 212-556-4204.) LR QL UR (JT LR ) QL UR By RICHARD W. STEVENSON LR QC QL UR c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service LR QC QL   WASHINGTON _ The economy created jobs at a surprisingly robust pace in January, the government reported on Friday, evidence that America's economic stamina has withstood any disruptions caused so far by the financial tumult in Asia. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said the economy added 358,000 jobs last month, far above the 235,000 forecast by economists. It was the third consecutive month that job generation has been exceptionally strong. With growing opportunities for work drawing more people into the labor force, the unemployment rate remained at 4.7 percent last month, just a notch above its quarter-century low. The demand for workers also led employers to raise wages again last month. Average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees rose 4 cents, to $12.51. The gain left wages 3.8 percent higher than a year earlier, extending a trend that has given back to workers some of the earning power they lost to inflation in the last decade. But economists said the wage increase was not enough to raise any concerns about higher inflation. And because the Federal Reserve has made clear that it expects the economy to slow in coming months as ripple effects from Asia reach the United States, investors disregarded the large jobs gains, betting that neither a rise in interest rates nor resurgent inflation is looming. Stocks rose, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up 72.24 points, to 8,189.49, leaving the index within 70 points of its record high set on Aug. 6. In the bond market, a sensitive barometer of inflation anxiety, prices edged up, pushing down the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond to 5.92 percent from 5.93 percent. ``Job creation is sturdy and we have effective price stability,'' said Paul McCulley, an economist at UBS Securities. ``The bottom line is that we've got a lovely economy.'' With potential inflation counterbalanced by worries about possible price declines, the Fed and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, have suggested that they intend to keep interest rates unchanged until the economy tilts clearly in one direction or another. The job figures for January extended a surge in employment gains that began last fall, just when the labor market had showed signs of cooling. After accounting for a small downward revision Friday to December's figures, the economy has been creating jobs at a rate of 358,000 a month for the last four months _ and 381,000 over the last three months _ after averaging 242,000 for the first nine months of 1997. The surge in jobs reflects a remarkable confluence of positive and self-reinforcing economic forces. Inflation has been almost nonexistent, and consumer confidence has been extremely strong. After a short, sharp drop when Asia's financial problems first became clear, the stock market has rebounded and corporate profits have remained healthy. Long-term interest rates, an important indicator of economic stability, have fallen in the last few months. Lower rates have helped invigorate housing and other interest-sensitive sectors of the economy by making loans more affordable, and have allowed companies to continue investing heavily in more efficient equipment. The likelihood that the federal budget will soon move from deficit into surplus has further improved the outlook. The less money the government needs to borrow, the more is freed for private investment. President Clinton welcomed the job figures at a news conference Friday. His advisers said the results reflected not just from balancing the budget, but also initiatives like improved access to education and training and the opening of foreign markets to trade. ``There are enormous economic and social benefits from our nation's high-employment economy,'' said Janet Yellen, the chairwoman of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers. Some of the biggest employment gains came in the construction industry, which added 92,000 jobs in January. The increase reflected the strength of the housing industry, which has been helped not just by declining interest rates but also by unusually warm weather. Service industries also showed solid job gains, as did manufacturers, two areas expected to be hardest hit when the effects of the Asian crisis hit the American economy. The major harm from Asia is likely to come from the plunge in the value of many Asian currencies relative to the dollar, a situation that is expected to lead to a surge of inexpensive imports into the United States, hurting American competitors. And the weakness of the Asian economies is also likely to lead to decreased demand for American exports. ``The economy has been running on the fumes of the strength from before the Asia shock,'' McCulley said. ``Those fumes will exhaust themselves, and the manufacturing sector is going to start getting beat up in the spring.'' The figures showed the unemployment rate for adult men declined to 3.8 percent last month from 4.1 percent in December, the lowest figure for almost two decades. The rate for adult women rose 0.4 percent, to 4.4 percent. For the first time, the Labor Department broke out unemployment by education level as well as gender, age and race. The analysis showed unemployment rates dropped steadily with higher levels of education. Among people with less than a high school education, the rate in January was 7.2 percent. Among high school graduates, the rate was 3.9 percent, and college graduates, 1.9 percent.   NYT-02-06-98 2219EST"

Late Monday, U.S. State Department officials said that travel visas had been approved for Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, his immediate family and three other people _ a pediatrician, a psychologist and one of Elian's favorite cousins. The group might come to the U.S. as soon as Tuesday, according to unconfirmed media reports.  But Miami's volatile Cuban exiles continued to vow they would block any attempt to take Elian from the Little Havana home where he has been living with his Miami relatives, with some predicting bloodshed if federal agents come for the boy.  ``There will be thousands here to stop it if they come for him,'' said Ana Bonnin, one of about 100 exiles who practiced forming a human chain outside the home Monday. ``We'll try to do it peacefully, but you can only do so much. You can't control everybody.''  Late in the day, lawyers for Elian's Miami family emerged from their third day-long meeting with federal officials, but said little.  ``We continue to be very concerned about the mental and psychological well-being of this 6-year-old,'' said Manny Diaz, one of the family's attorneys. ``To that end, we'll be back tomorrow to continue our negotiations.''  Federal officials made no immediate comment.  It was not clear whether the Gonzalez family would come to Miami to get Elian or if instead they would travel to Washington, D.C.  Cuban President Fidel Castro has said they would live in the home of a Cuban diplomat in the Washington area until the court case surrounding Elian's fate is resolved.  Visas for the entourage of more than 20 teachers, classmates and others _ including Ricardo Alarcon, Cuban National Assembly president _ that Castro wants to accompany the family were not yet approved, officials said.  The rush of events caps a four-month ordeal that has seen Elian catapulted into the center an international tug-of-war. He was found floating in an inner-tube off the Florida coast on Thanksgiving Day after a boat carrying him from Cuba sank. His mother and 10 other people drowned.  Federal officials placed him with his Miami relatives, but kept custody over him. In January, Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner ruled that Elian should go back to Cuba, a decision upheld by U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno.  The Miami relatives filed a federal lawsuit to overturn the decision, but in March a Miami federal judge ruled against them. They immediately appealed to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.  Legal experts and federal officials maintain that Reno can allow the boy to be sent back to Cuba before the appeal is heard.  Last week, federal officials sought to have the family must sign an agreement to turn the boy over voluntarily should they lose their appeal. If the family refused, INS had threatened to revoke Elian's parole, meaning federal officials would take him from the Miami family.  The family refused to sign the agreement through two days of negotiations, and INS extended its deadline until 9 a.m. EST Tuesday.  The terms of the talks changed dramatically, however, when Castro announced last Wednesday that the boy's father was ready to travel to the United States. Previously, Gonzalez had said he would never come here to get his son.  Over the weekend, lawyers for the family raised accusations that Juan Miguel Gonzalez had mistreated his son in telephone conversations, saying he had told the boy that his mother was alive and waiting for him in Cuba.  But by Monday, federal officials hardened their negotiating stance, insisting the boy would be turned over to his father once the Cuban group arrives in the United States.  Moves to keep Elian in this country through federal legislation appear to be stymied, as most lawmakers seem to agree the boy should go back to Cuba. A new ABC News-Washington Post opinion poll shows that 6 of 10 Americans also believe the boy should go home with his father.  But in Miami, Cuban exiles insist the majority of Americans don't understand the dynamics of life in Cuba. Just how far they are willing to go to prove their point remains to be seen.  ``If he goes back, he won't be with his real father,'' said Elias Hernandez, who joined the crowd outside the Little Havana home of Elian's Miami relatives. ``His father will be Fidel Castro, the worst dictator in history.''

The company said it was delaying construction because of current market conditions. But the Memphis, Tenn., facility wasn't to begin turning out product until 1993, so the decision may reveal a more pessimistic long-term outlook as well.  Kellogg, which hasn't been as successful in capitalizing on the public's health-oriented desire for oat bran as rival General Mills Inc., has been losing share in the $6 billion ready-to-eat cereal market. Kellogg's current share is believed to be slightly under 40% while General Mills' share is about 27%.  Led by its oat-based Cheerios line, General Mills has gained an estimated 2% share so far this year, mostly at the expense of Kellogg. Each share point is worth about $60 million in sales.  Analysts say much of Kellogg's erosion has been in such core brands as Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies and Frosted Flakes, which represent nearly one-third of its sales volume. Kellogg is so anxious to turn around Corn Flakes sales that it soon will begin selling boxes for as little as 99 cents, trade sources say.  ""Cheerios and Honey Nut Cheerios have eaten away sales normally going to Kellogg's corn-based lines simply because they are made of oats,"" says Merrill Lynch food analyst William Maguire. ""They are not a happy group of people at Battle Creek right now."" Kellogg is based in Battle Creek, Mich., a city that calls itself the breakfast capital of the world.  Another analyst, John C.

People are reading the boxes and deciding they want something that's `healthy' for you -- oats, bran."" Mr. Maxwell said he wouldn't be surprised if, over the next two years or so, General Mills' share increased to 30% or more.  In announcing the plant delay, Kellogg Chairman William E. LaMothe said, ""Cereal volume growth in the U.S. has not met our expectations for 1989"". He said construction wouldn't resume until market conditions warrant it.  Kellogg indicated that it has room to grow without adding facilities. The company has five other U.S. plants, including a modern facility at its Battle Creek headquarters known as Building 100, which is to add bran-processing and rice-processing capacity next year.  General Mills, meanwhile, finds itself constrained from boosting sales further because its plants are operating at capacity. A large plant in Covington, Ga., is to come on line next year.  A Kellogg officer, who asked not to be named, said the Memphis project was "" pulled in for a reconsideration of costs,"" an indication that the ambitious plans might be scaled back in any future construction. Initial cost estimates for the plant, which was to have been built in phases, ranged from $1 billion to $1.2 billion.  A company spokesman said it was ""possible, but highly unlikely,"" that the plant might never be built. ""As we regain our leadership level where we have been, and as we continue to put new products into the marketplace and need additional capacity, we will look at resuming our involvement with our plan,"" he said.  The new facility was to have been the world's most advanced cereal manufacturing plant, and Kellogg's largest construction project. The company had retained the Fluor Daniel unit of Fluor Corp. as general contractor.  But in recent weeks, construction-industry sources reported that early preparation work was slowing at the 185-acre site. Subcontractors said they were told that equipment orders would be delayed. Fluor Daniel already has reassigned most of its work crew, the sources said.  Last Friday's announcement was the first official word that the project was in trouble and that the company's plans for a surge in market share may have been overly optimistic.

Although he called current market conditions ""highly competitive,"" Mr. LaMothe, Kellogg's chairman and chief executive officer, forecast an earnings increase for the full year. Last year, the company earned $480.4 million, or $3.90 a share, on sales of $4.3 billion.  As expected, Kellogg reported lower third-quarter earnings. Net fell 16% to $123.1 million, or $1.02 a share, from $145.7 million, or $1.18 a share. Sales rose 4.8% to $1.20 billion from $1.14 billion.

Seib Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 02/25/91 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A1 MDEST EUROP FREST EXECUTIVE (EXE) DEFENSE DEPARTMENT (DEF) STATE DEPARTMENT (STD) WASHINGTON -- With the ground battle to liberate Kuwait proceeding with surprising speed and success, Bush administration officials are optimistic the Persian Gulf war can begin winding down in a matter of days. The enormous ground offensive by U.S. Marines and Army troops, at least during its first 24 hours, met only sporadic Iraqi resistance as it quickly penetrated deep into Kuwait and parts of Iraq, military officials said. According to press pool reports, U.S. Marines are already on the outskirts of Kuwait City.   ""So far, the offensive is progressing with dramatic success,"" said a buoyant Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of U.S. forces. Similarly, while cautioning about the uncertainty of early battle reports, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said late yesterday that ""the operation has been very successful."" Amid reports that thousands of Iraqi soldiers had surrendered, administration aides were also upbeat in private, with one even talking of victory within a week. But even continued military success carries political and diplomatic risks for President Bush and the U.S. The allied rejection of the last-minute Soviet-led diplomatic effort to avoid the ground war enabled Mr. Bush to seize the initiative from an Iraq seemingly bent on dictating peace terms. But it has offended some, especially in Arab countries, who now believe that Mr. Bush's real objectives are the demise of Saddam Hussein and the destruction of the Iraqi military, not just the liberation of Kuwait. ""Why have a war?"" asked Abdul Latif Shekar, a customs officer in Egypt, a country participating in the attack on Iraqi troops. ""I think the Gorbachev plan was a good one. Iraq was ready to withdraw."" Now, he says, ""it looks like the West just wants to destroy Iraq."" Despite the early indications of success, the allied forces could still suffer greater casualties and become bogged down militarily, especially when they encounter the tough Republican Guard, which is entrenched along the Iraq-Kuwait border. If so, and if it appears that the American goal actually is to destroy the Iraqi regime even at the cost of badly hurting Iraqi society, ""the lingering cost of that could be high,"" worries former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. But, he notes, ""If everything crumbles totally, that won't be such a problem."" American officials staunchly disavow any interest in driving through Iraq toward Baghdad, either in pursuit of Saddam Hussein himself or to set up some American-controlled government inside Iraq. The Americans say their battle plans call for operating against forces inside Iraq as far north as the city of Basra, about 30 miles north of Kuwait, but say there isn't any plan to drive beyond that. Indeed, French President Francois Mitterrand said yesterday that some allied forces are crossing Iraqi territory as part of a ""pincer"" movement to trap the soldiers occupying Kuwait, but insisted, ""The purpose isn't to invade Iraqi territory, that's not the aim, that isn't the mandate."" Nevertheless, American officials over the weekend became more open in declaring that by destroying Saddam Hussein's military machine they hope to destroy his regime -- a goal likely to be supported by most Americans. In a pre-attack message, Lt. Gen. Walter Boomer, the top Marine in the Persian Gulf, told U.S. Marines that their goal is to "" restore {Kuwait} to its citizens."" He went on to add that ""in so doing you not only return a nation to its people, but you will destroy the war machine of a ruthless dictator."" Secretary of State James Baker said on ABC-TV's ""This Week With David Brinkley"" that the series of United Nations resolutions condemning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait ""imply that the restoration of peace and stability in the Gulf would be a heck of a lot easier if he and that leadership were not in power in Iraq."" Of course, it is still far too early to assume that the military situation on the ground will stay as smooth for allied forces as it appears to have been so far. Iraq still has the potential to cause significant problems by using forces and weapons that don't yet seem fully engaged. For one thing, Iraq still apparently hasn't unleashed its stockpile of chemical weapons. Gen. Schwarzkopf said that some early reports that chemical weapons were used against allied troops turned out to be ""bogus."" Iraq is believed to have the ability to deliver chemical weapons in artillery shells or, perhaps, atop Soviet-made Frog7 missiles. Perhaps more important, it appears that allied troops haven't yet fully engaged Iraq's vaunted Republican Guard, which has been sitting just north of the Iraq-Kuwait border and is considered the most potent element in the Iraqi defense. It remains to be seen how much damage the allied air campaign was able to inflict on the Guard, and whether President Hussein will commit his most valued troops to a fight-to-the-death finish. Certainly Saddam Hussein continues to implore his country to fight on. ""Fight them,"" he urged Iraqis in a radio address. ""All Iraqis, fight them with all the power you have, and all struggle for everything."" American war planners have long assumed that the early stage of the ground attack, in which American forces would use their speed to sweep around Iraqi defenses and their strength to punch through the relatively weak Iraqi front line, would be the easiest part. Despite these early successes, the mere fact that a ground campaign has begun almost guarantees that the Bush administration will face fresh problems growing out of the military situation. There are likely to be additional American prisoners of war taken, and there are signs that President Hussein is taking Kuwaiti hostages. U.S. and Kuwaiti officials say there are reports that large numbers of civilians from Kuwait City are being rounded up and held by Iraqi troops, apparently either for use as human shields or for use later in bargaining once the war is over. President Bush's political argument for going to a ground war has been strengthened by the growing stream of reports of wanton Iraqi destruction inside Kuwait. U.S. officials say that hundreds of Kuwaiti oil wells now may have been set afire. And Robert Gates, Mr. Bush's deputy national security adviser, asserted in an interview on the Cable News Network that Iraqi troops have set fire to ""large sections"" of Kuwait City. Mr. Bush and his aides were leaning toward a military conclusion of the crisis even before the latest reports of Iraqi atrocities in Kuwait came to light. The president and his top aides tentatively decided on Feb. 11 that a ground war would be necessary. The decision was made after Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, returned from a visit with military commanders in Saudi Arabia, administration officials say. Then, a week or so ago, Gen. Schwarzkopf secretly picked Saturday night as the optimal time to start the offensive. The date was unaffected by the last-ditch Soviet peace initiative. The real problem with the Soviet proposals, U.S. officials now say, was that they all would have required lifting economic sanctions against Iraq. The Bush administration considers the sanctions essential to keeping Saddam Hussein under control should he survive the war. Mr. Bush forestalled further diplomatic maneuvering by issuing an ultimatum on behalf of the allies demanding that Iraq withdraw within a week, starting at noon Saturday. Administration aides said that the idea of the ultimatum was Gen. Powell's. He argued setting an explicit deadline for Saddam Hussein to break would, when it was broken, give the U.S. military a clear green light to proceed. In setting out his final challenge to Saddam Hussein, Mr. Bush continued the intensive personal diplomacy he began after the invasion last August. After cabling world leaders about his intention to give Saddam Hussein a final deadline to exit Kuwait, he offered him a week to withdraw fully, instead of the four days he originally considered, because of objections from some European partners that four days seemed punitive and unrealistic. And when he and President Gorbachev spoke about the decision in a talk lasting nearly an hour, the President took pains to listen to what his counterpart had to say, although he already had decided that the Soviet alternative to the allied deadline was unacceptable. Finally, when Iraq failed to respond to the U.S. ultimatum, Mr. Bush let the ground offensive begin as previously planned Saturday night. The attack was lightning quick, as allied forces punched through tall sand berms on the border and pushed forward into Iraq and Kuwait. U.S. Marines were said to have breached troublesome mine fields along the Iraqi lines but Pentagon officials said no amphibious assault on Kuwait's beaches had begun. Long columns of Iraqi prisoners of war could be seen trudging through the desert toward the allied rear. U.S. commanders said 5,500 Iraqi prisoners were taken in the first hours of the ground war, though some military officials later said the total may have climbed above 8,000. The U.S. hopes its troops will drive Iraqi forces out of Kuwait quickly, leaving much of Iraq's offensive military equipment destroyed or abandoned in Kuwait. It expects that tens of thousands of Iraqi soldiers will surrender to the U.S. and its allies over the next few days. If the allies succeed, Saddam Hussein will have plunged his country first into a fruitless eight-year war against Iran and then into a humiliating war against the U.S. and the allies to defend his conquest of Kuwait, leaving much of his country's military establishment and modern infrastructure in ruins. Meanwhile, the U.S. hopes, economic sanctions and an international arms embargo will remain in effect until Iraq pays war reparations to Kuwait to cover war damages. That would undermine any chances of rebuilding either Iraq or its armed forces in short order as long as Saddam Hussein remains in power. The American hope is that someone from within Iraq, perhaps from the army's professional ranks, will step forward and push Saddam Hussein aside so that the country can begin recovering from the disaster. Outside analysts think Saddam Hussein's position is indeed precarious. ""I think frankly Saddam is finished, no matter what happens,"" says Christine Helms, a Middle East scholar who has written extensively about Iraq. ""These guys simply don't retire to condos over the Euphrates."" Despite the lack of any obvious successors, the Iraqi leader's internal power base appeared to be narrowing even before the war began. Some analysts say he appeared to be relying on a smaller and smaller circle of close advisers and relatives. If that's true, the narrowing of his support would make it easier for someone to push him aside from within. Yet, paradoxically, the perception that the U.S. wants to destroy Iraq may increase Saddam Hussein's support within the Iraqi military. And the U.S. now will face sharper questions in the Arab world since it didn't back the peace proposals worked out in Moscow. ""We looked to the United States, we expected you to have the moral edge,"" says Nasser Tahboub, a Jerusalem-born Jordanian who has an American wife and a doctorate in political science from Duke University. ""Now we see that edge eroded. For me, it is a great tragedy. For the first time in history, the U.S. has gone to war with an Arab and Muslim nation, and we know a peaceful solution was in reach."" --- Geraldine Brooks in Amman, Jordan, and Craig Forman in Cairo, Egypt, contributed to this article."
