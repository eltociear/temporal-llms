1,chomsky_on_gaza.ascii.TE3input.tml,IS e1002 AFTER e1001,Were two Palestinian boys shot after Israeli rampage?,no,"Amid all the horrors unfolding in the latest Israeli offensive in Gaza, Israel's goal is simple: quiet-for-quiet, a return to the norm.  For the West Bank, the norm is that Israel continues its illegal construction of settlements and infrastructure so that it can integrate into Israel whatever might be of value, meanwhile consigning Palestinians to unviable cantons and subjecting them to repression and violence.  For Gaza, the norm is a miserable existence under a cruel and destructive siege that Israel administers to permit bare survival but nothing more.  The latest Israeli rampage was set off by the brutal murder of three Israeli boys from a settler community in the occupied West Bank. A month before, two Palestinian boys were shot dead in the West Bank city of Ramallah. That elicited little attention, which is understandable, since it is routine.  ""The institutionalized disregard for Palestinian life in the West helps explain not only why Palestinians resort to violence,"" Middle East analyst Mouin Rabbani reports, ""but also Israel's latest assault on the Gaza Strip.""  In an interview, human rights lawyer Raji Sourani, who has remained in Gaza through years of Israeli brutality and terror, said, ""The most common sentence I heard when people began to talk about cease-fire: Everybody says it's better for all of us to die and not go back to the situation we used to have before this war. We don't want that again. We have no dignity, no pride; we are just soft targets, and we are very cheap. Either this situation really improves or it is better to just die. I am talking about intellectuals, academics, ordinary people: Everybody is saying that.""  In January 2006, Palestinians committed a major crime: They voted the wrong way in a carefully monitored free election, handing control of Parliament to Hamas.  The media constantly intone that Hamas is dedicated to the destruction of Israel. In reality, Hamas leaders have repeatedly made it clear that Hamas would accept a two-state settlement in accord with the international consensus that has been blocked by the U.S. and Israel for 40 years.  In contrast, Israel is dedicated to the destruction of Palestine, apart from some occasional meaningless words, and is implementing that commitment.  The crime of the Palestinians in January 2006 was punished at once. The U.S. and Israel, with Europe shamefully trailing behind, imposed harsh sanctions on the errant population and Israel stepped up its violence.  The U.S. and Israel quickly initiated plans for a military coup to overthrow the elected government. When Hamas had the effrontery to foil the plans, the Israeli assaults and the siege became far more severe.  There should be no need to review again the dismal record since. The relentless siege and savage attacks are punctuated by episodes of ""mowing the lawn,"" to borrow Israel's cheery expression for its periodic exercises in shooting fish in a pond as part of what it calls a ""war of defense.""  Once the lawn is mowed and the desperate population seeks to rebuild somehow from the devastation and the murders, there is a cease-fire agreement. The most recent cease-fire was established after Israel's October 2012 assault, called Operation Pillar of Defense .  Though Israel maintained its siege, Hamas observed the cease-fire, as Israel concedes. Matters changed in April of this year when Fatah and Hamas forged a unity agreement that established a new government of technocrats unaffiliated with either party.  Israel was naturally furious, all the more so when even the Obama administration joined the West in signaling approval. The unity agreement not only undercuts Israel's claim that it cannot negotiate with a divided Palestine but also threatens the long-term goal of dividing Gaza from the West Bank and pursuing its destructive policies in both regions.  Something had to be done, and an occasion arose on June 12, when the three Israeli boys were murdered in the West Bank. Early on, the Netanyahu government knew that they were dead, but pretended otherwise, which provided the opportunity to launch a rampage in the West Bank, targeting Hamas.  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed to have certain knowledge that Hamas was responsible. That too was a lie.  One of Israel's leading authorities on Hamas, Shlomi Eldar, reported almost at once that the killers very likely came from a dissident clan in Hebron that has long been a thorn in the side of Hamas. Eldar added that ""I'm sure they didn't get any green light from the leadership of Hamas, they just thought it was the right time to act.""  The 18-day rampage after the kidnapping, however, succeeded in undermining the feared unity government, and sharply increasing Israeli repression. Israel also conducted dozens of attacks in Gaza, killing five Hamas members on July 7.  Hamas finally reacted with its first rockets in 19 months, providing Israel with the pretext for Operation Protective Edge on July 8.  By July 31, around 1,400 Palestinians had been killed, mostly civilians, including hundreds of women and children. And three Israeli civilians. Large areas of Gaza had been turned into rubble. Four hospitals had been attacked, each another war crime.  Israeli officials laud the humanity of what it calls ""the most moral army in the world,"" which informs residents that their homes will be bombed. The practice is ""sadism, sanctimoniously disguising itself as mercy,"" in the words of Israeli journalist Amira Hass: ""A recorded message demanding hundreds of thousands of people leave their already targeted homes, for another place, equally dangerous, 10 kilometers away.""  In fact, there is no place in the prison of Gaza safe from Israeli sadism, which may even exceed the terrible crimes of Operation Cast Lead in 2008-2009.  The hideous revelations elicited the usual reaction from the most moral president in the world, Barack Obama: great sympathy for Israelis, bitter condemnation of Hamas and calls for moderation on both sides.  When the current attacks are called off, Israel hopes to be free to pursue its criminal policies in the occupied territories without interference, and with the U.S. support it has enjoyed in the past.  Gazans will be free to return to the norm in their Israeli-run prison, while in the West Bank, Palestinians can watch in peace as Israel dismantles what remains of their possessions.  That is the likely outcome if the U.S. maintains its decisive and virtually unilateral support for Israeli crimes and its rejection of the long-standing international consensus on diplomatic settlement. But the future will be quite different if the U.S. withdraws that support.  In that case it would be possible to move toward the ""enduring solution"" in Gaza that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called for, eliciting hysterical condemnation in Israel because the phrase could be interpreted as calling for an end to Israel's siege and regular attacks. And - horror of horrors - the phrase might even be interpreted as calling for implementation of international law in the rest of the occupied territories.  Forty years ago Israel made the fateful decision to choose expansion over security, rejecting a full peace treaty offered by Egypt in return for evacuation from the occupied Egyptian Sinai, where Israel was initiating extensive settlement and development projects. Israel has adhered to that policy ever since.  If the U.S. decided to join the world, the impact would be great. Over and over, Israel has abandoned cherished plans when Washington has so demanded. Such are the relations of power between them.  Furthermore, Israel by now has little recourse, after having adopted policies that turned it from a country that was greatly admired to one that is feared and despised, policies it is pursuing with blind determination today in its march toward moral deterioration and possible ultimate destruction.  Could U.S. policy change? It's not impossible. Public opinion has shifted considerably in recent years, particularly among the young, and it cannot be completely ignored.  For some years there has been a good basis for public demands that Washington observe its own laws and cut off military aid to Israel. U.S. law requires that ""no security assistance may be provided to any country the government of which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.""  Israel most certainly is guilty of this consistent pattern, and has been for many years.  Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, author of this provision of the law, has brought up its potential applicability to Israel in specific cases, and with a well-conducted educational, organizational and activist effort such initiatives could be pursued successively.  That could have a very significant impact in itself, while also providing a springboard for further actions to compel Washington to become part of ""the international community"" and to observe international law and norms.  Nothing could be more significant for the tragic Palestinian victims of many years of violence and repression.   Copyright 2014 Noam Chomsky"

Mr. Brady was injured on March 30, 1981, when a mentally troubled man, John Hinckley Jr. , opened fire at the Washington Hilton Hotel seeking to impress actress Jodie Foster. Mr. Brady, 40 years old at the time, was one of four men shot, including the president, a Secret Service officer and a District of Columbia police officer. Mr. Brady's injuries proved the longest-lasting and left him in a wheelchair for much of the rest of his life.  For the remainder of the Reagan administration, Mr. Brady retained his press-secretary title while deputies took over daily operations. Mr. Brady would appear at the White House about once a week, allowing him to provide strategic advice to Larry Speakes, who took over daily press-secretary duties, and maintain social ties to the administration.  In 1987, Mr. Brady's wife, Sarah, initiated an effort to require purchasers of handguns to undergo criminal background checks before taking possession of a gun. Mr. Hinckley wasn't screened before buying his gun from a licensed dealer and used a false address on a required federal firearms-purchase form.  Mr. Brady first spoke out in favor of what became known as the Brady bill in November 1989, saying he was disgusted by Congress's inaction on the issue when faced with gun-violence statistics. ""Well, this statistic has decided to break his silence,"" he told the Senate Judiciary Committee.  He described the physical difficulties he had faced since the shooting, requiring assistance to get out of bed, to eat, to get dressed. ""I even need help to go to the bathroom,"" he said.  The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act was signed into law in 1993 by President Bill Clinton, after several years of debate and opposition from the National Rifle Association.  ""He would patrol the halls of Congress, his wife pushing his wheelchair, persuading members of Congress that this was the right thing to do,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y), a leading sponsor of the Brady bill.  ""I was deeply saddened to learn of Jim Brady's passing today,"" former first lady Nancy Reagan said in a written statement. ""Thinking of him brings back so many memories-happy and sad-of a time in all of our lives when we learned what it means to 'play the hand we're dealt.' "" She added, ""I still remember vividly that day in March 1981, when Sarah and I sat together in a tiny room near the emergency room at George Washington University Hospital, trying to comfort each other while we both were gripped with unspeakable fear.""  In 1997, Mr. Clinton awarded Mr. Brady the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. In 2000, the White House press briefing room was renamed in his honor.  In recent months, Mr. Brady's health began a steep decline, with bouts of pneumonia and other ailments, said Gail Hoffman, a family spokeswoman. The cause of death wasn't yet clear.  ""Life was very difficult for him-he was in a lot of pain every day,"" said Ms. Hoffman, who served as the legislative director of Handgun Control Inc., the Bradys' organization fighting to pass the gun-control legislation. The group was later renamed the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.  Mr. Brady, who served as press secretary for the first two months of the Reagan administration, is remembered by colleagues and friends as a skilled and evenhanded arbiter between the press and the administration.

This racially freighted history lives on in current federal policy, which is so driven by myth and propaganda that it is almost impervious to reason.  The cannabis plant, also known as hemp, was widely grown in the United States for use in fabric during the mid-19th century. The practice of smoking it appeared in Texas border towns around 1900, brought by Mexican immigrants who cultivated cannabis as an intoxicant and for medicinal purposes as they had done at home.  Within 15 years or so, it was plentiful along the Texas border and was advertised openly at grocery markets and drugstores, some of which shipped small packets by mail to customers in other states.  The law enforcement view of marijuana was indelibly shaped by the fact that it was initially connected to brown people from Mexico and subsequently with black and poor communities in this country. Police in Texas border towns demonized the plant in racial terms as the drug of ""immoral"" populations who were promptly labeled ""fiends.""  As the legal scholars Richard Bonnie and Charles Whitebread explain in their authoritative history, ""The Marihuana Conviction,"" the drug's popularity among minorities and other groups practically ensured that it would be classified as a ""narcotic,"" attributed with addictive qualities it did not have, and set alongside far more dangerous drugs like heroin and morphine.  By the early 1930s, more than 30 states had prohibited the use of marijuana for nonmedical purposes. The federal push was yet to come.  The stage for federal suppression of marijuana was set in New Orleans, where a prominent doctor blamed ""muggle-heads"" - as pot smokers were called - for an outbreak of robberies. The city was awash in sensationalistic newspaper articles that depicted pushers hovering by the schoolhouse door turning children into ""addicts."" These stories popularized spurious notions about the drug that lingered for decades. Law enforcement officials, too, trafficked in the ""assassin"" theory, under in which killers were said to have smoked cannabis to ready themselves for murder and mayhem.  In 1930, Congress consolidated the drug control effort in the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, led by the endlessly resourceful commissioner, Harry Jacob Anslinger, who became the architect of national prohibition. His case rested on two fantastical assertions: that the drug caused insanity; that it pushed people toward horrendous acts of criminality. Others at the time argued that it was fiercely addictive.  He may not have actually believed his propaganda, but he fed it by giving lurid stories to the press as a way of making a case for federal intervention. This narrative had a great effect at Congressional hearings that led to the enactment of The Marijuana Tax Act of 1937, which tried to eradicate the use and sale of the drug through heavy taxation.  Mr. Bonnie and Mr. Whitebread report that the witness list for those hearings contained not a single person who had done significant research into the effects of cannabis. Mr. Anslinger testified that even a single marijuana cigarette could induce a ""homicidal mania,"" prompting people to want to kill those they loved. The bill passed handily; President Franklin Roosevelt signed it into law.  It was not until 1951, when Congress again took up the issue, that a reputable researcher was called to testify. Dr. Harris Isbell, director of research at the Public Health Service Hospital in Lexington, Ky., disputed the insanity, crime and addiction theories, telling Congress that ""smoking marijuana has no unpleasant aftereffects, no dependence is developed on the drug, and the practice can easily be stopped at any time.""  Despite Dr. Isbell's testimony, Congress ratcheted up penalties on users. The states followed the federal example; Louisiana, for instance, created sentences ranging from five to 99 years, without parole or probation, for sale, possession or administration of narcotic drugs. The rationale was not that marijuana itself was addictive - that argument was suddenly relinquished - but that it was a ""steppingstone"" to heroin addiction. This passed largely without comment at the time.  The country accepted a senselessly punitive approach to sentencing as long as minorities and the poor paid the price. But, by the late 1960s, weed had been taken up by white college students from the middle and upper classes. Seeing white lives ruined by marijuana laws altered public attitudes about harsh sentencing, and, in 1972, the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse released a report challenging the approach.  The commission concluded that criminalization was ""too harsh a tool to apply to personal possession even in the effort to discourage use,"" and that ""the actual and potential harm of use of the drug is not great enough to justify intrusion by the criminal law into private behavior, a step which our society takes only with the greatest reluctance."" The Nixon administration dismissed these ideas.  During the mid-1970s, virtually all states softened penalties for marijuana possession. Thirty-five states and the District of Columbia have made medical use of some form of the drug legal. The Justice Department's recent decision not to sue states that legalize marijuana - as long as they have strong enforcement rules - eases the tension between state and federal laws only slightly but leaves a great many legal problems unresolved.  The federal government has taken a small step back from irrational enforcement. But it clings to a policy that has its origins in racism and xenophobia and whose principal effect has been to ruin the lives of generations of people.  Copyright New York Times."

The commission concluded that criminalization was ""too harsh a tool to apply to personal possession even in the effort to discourage use,"" and that ""the actual and potential harm of use of the drug is not great enough to justify intrusion by the criminal law into private behavior, a step which our society takes only with the greatest reluctance."" The Nixon administration dismissed these ideas.  During the mid-1970s, virtually all states softened penalties for marijuana possession. Thirty-five states and the District of Columbia have made medical use of some form of the drug legal. The Justice Department's recent decision not to sue states that legalize marijuana - as long as they have strong enforcement rules - eases the tension between state and federal laws only slightly but leaves a great many legal problems unresolved.  The federal government has taken a small step back from irrational enforcement. But it clings to a policy that has its origins in racism and xenophobia and whose principal effect has been to ruin the lives of generations of people.  Copyright New York Times."

In a blog, the US firm said Samsung had used Microsoft's takeover of Nokia's handset unit ""as an excuse to breach its contract"".  Samsung has said: ""We will review the complaint in detail and determine appropriate measures in response.""  The case marks the first time that Microsoft has launched legal action against Samsung.  The two companies have a long-running partnership, due to the Asian manufacturer's sale of Windows PCs and Windows Phone handsets.  Nokia deal Although Microsoft is best known for its own Windows operating system, it also claims ownership to hundreds of patents relating to Google's Android OS.  It has pursued many Android device-makers for related licence fees and to date has struck deals with more than 25 companies, including HTC, Acer, ZTE and Nikon.  Samsung agreed to Microsoft's demands in September 2011 and made its first year's payment the following year.  But a censored copy of court papers filed by Microsoft's lawyer, and posted online by news site Geekwire, indicate that Samsung blocked a second payment after learning of the Nokia deal in September 2013.  Although the documents state that Samsung later paid the fee in November 2013, Microsoft claims it is still owed money to cover the interest on the sum over the period it was not paid.  In addition the US company is unhappy that Samsung is reserving the right not to make future payments.  It also complains that Samsung has asked the Korean competition authorities to intervene to eliminate the need for future fees - a matter that Microsoft says would be outside the regulators' authority.  Furthermore, the papers suggest Samsung has threatened Microsoft with its own patent infringement claims relating to the Nokia takeover.  ""Microsoft values and respects our partnership with Samsung and expects it to continue. We are simply asking the court to settle our disagreement, and we are confident the contract will be enforced,"" wrote David Howard, deputy general counsel for Microsoft, on the firm's blog.  Samsung declined to discuss any of the specific claims.  Microsoft has never disclosed how much it makes from its Android patents, but analysts have estimated the figure is between $1bn (GBP 595m) to $2bn a year.

69,russian_pilgrims.ascii.TE3input.tml,IS e2 AFTER t0,"Is the 700th birthday after Aug 2, 2014?",no,"SERGIYEV POSAD, Russia - The pilgrims tramped toward the storied monastery by the thousands - chanting prayers, singing and embracing the kind of nationalist fervor that President Vladimir V. Putin seeks to harness as his own.  The official reason for the trek to the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius, the seat of the Russian Orthodox faith and the country's original monastery, was to commemorate the 700th birthday of its founder and namesake.  But amid that tide of pilgrims - official estimates hovered around 30,000 - swirled diverse political and religious currents related to Mr. Putin's effort to cast himself as the defender of traditional values, a campaign that has become more pronounced since Russia's involvement with Ukraine.  The birthday celebrations in Sergiyev Posad emphasized St. Sergius's role in shaping a unified Russia, a narrative that dovetails with the nationalism and conservative morals that Mr. Putin espouses.  Some historians and church figures are crying foul, however, over what they say are the Kremlin's efforts to reshape the saint's legacy to enhance political goals, fostering what one critic called ""an official cult.""  ""They are creating a myth around St. Sergius, making him out to be an obedient servant of the Russian state, which he was not,"" said Irina Karatsuba, a historian who often aligns herself with unpopular causes. ""He is one of the important embodiments of what was and is the best in Russia. But the way they are trying to link him to the Russian state is nonsense; it's political manipulation.""  The pilgrimage illustrates one way Mr. Putin is trying to use Russian Orthodoxy as a tie that binds Russians together, analysts said, fashioning a fresh ideology for his continued rule after 14 years as either president or prime minister. His participation in the St. Sergius celebration last month was broadcast live nationally.  Church officials said they wanted St. Sergius to serve as an example of spiritual hope for Russians in their daily lives.  The Russian Orthodox Church was resurrected after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, ending 70 years of often brutal Communist repression. The church seems only too happy to hitch its halting rebirth to Mr. Putin's fortunes, hoping to attract more adherents. Although 80 percent of the 140 million Russians identify themselves as Russian Orthodox culturally, the number who actually attend church is tiny. The church says it is nearly 10 percent, but experts say it has long hovered around 3 percent.  Another reason for St. Sergius's elevation is the current crisis in Ukraine.  The birth of the Russian Orthodox faith dates back to Vladimir the Great, grand prince of Kiev, and the mass baptisms performed at his behest there in 988, bringing Christianity to what then became Holy Rus.  But now that Russia and Ukraine are locked in a proxy war, the government and the church realize that the physical link to an important religious symbol is being severed, noted Geraldine Fagan, author of ""Believing in Russia - Religious Policy After Communism.""  Because those roots - not to mention the relics of St. Vladimir himself - are in the territory of an estranged neighbor, Russia appears to be casting St. Sergius as his replacement, Ms. Fagan said.  In the late 14th century, aside from founding the first monastery, St. Sergius of Radonezh persuaded the Russian princes to stop their murderous, internecine fighting and concentrate on throwing off the Mongol yoke.  ""St. Sergius was the beginning not just of Russian monasticism or the Russian spiritual tradition,"" said Vladimir Legoyda, the head of the information department for the Holy Synod. ""In many ways he is the source of Russia itself.""  The saint has long been revered as a humble figure, content to spend his days in prayer and dressing like a beggar. He turned down the job of leading the church, but was given the unique title of abbot for all Russia.  ""He is a great personality in Russian history,"" said Margarita Popova, a 48-year-old English teacher who traveled 17 hours by bus with her teenage son from their home near Volgograd for the anniversary. ""Russia before Sergei Radonezh and Russia after was perhaps two different Russias.""  Ordinary people, Ms. Popova said, do not have the time to pray for themselves, for Russia and for the world constantly. The monks who do so are following a tradition started in the Russian Orthodox Church by St. Sergius. He is often identified as the original staretz, a Russian word that means a monastic spiritual leader, one who has achieved tangible experience in the future kingdom of God.  Beyond spiritual matters, the crowd at the birthday commemoration at the monastery here, 45 miles north of Moscow, was unquestionably in the Putin camp. Many compared him to a czar, and meant it as a compliment.  ""He has just not been anointed,"" said Vladimir Bubelev, 60, an officer in the naval reserves wearing a brass pin showing the profile of Nicholas II, the last czar, on his lapel.  ""But his powers are greater than those of Nicholas II,"" Mr. Bubelev said. ""On many questions he acts like a monarch - he makes correct, willful decisions. This is very good. Plus he is a believer!""  As it happens, the birthday of St. Sergius and the anniversary of the death of Nicholas II fall within a couple of days of each other in July. The church made Nicholas II and his immediate family saints in 2000. The czar's 1917 overthrow was for many Orthodox faithful the last time that a man anointed by God governed Russia.  When the czars ruled, Mr. Bubelev persisted, Russia evoked both nobility and morality. The Romanovs deeply revered both St. Sergius and a later, 19th-century monk, St. Seraphim of Sarov, also worshiped by the Russian Orthodox.  ""They helped the czars rule Russia in the right way - they made Russia rich,"" Mr. Bubelev said. The czars ""went to their relics and asked for God's help, and they succeeded. Thank God Mr. Putin is asking for their help now.""  But Ms. Karatsuba, the historian, pointed out that the Romanov rulers also tried to elevate the concept of Holy Rus as a national ideal in their campaign to stall political reform in the 19th century. That turned out badly for them in 1917, she noted.  Still, the Slavic nationalism prevalent among the faithful makes them a natural base of support for Mr. Putin's policy that all ethnic Russians are worthy of protection wherever they are. That has been his stated reason for championing the cause of anti-Kiev insurgents in southeastern Ukraine.  ""We are all one people, we are all part of Holy Rus,"" said Dmitry Markov, 28, a buyer for a cellphone company who attended the St. Sergius commemoration. ""Any person, regardless of where he lives, if he is Russian in spirit, he must be defended by his president, by his country, because he is an indivisible part of the nation.""  Mr. Putin, who attended the anniversary celebration less than 24 hours after a civilian plane disaster in Ukraine that many blamed on Moscow, addressed the faithful for only about five minutes. He lauded the ""patriotic, national and moral resurgence"" inspired by the monk, including his campaign to build monasteries as both spiritual centers and real fortresses to protect Russia.  ""His wise and solid words as a mentor and guide were a spiritual pillar and support during a difficult time of foreign invasion and internal discord,"" Mr. Putin said.  ""It was then that he spoke his prophetic words: 'Our salvation lies in love and unity,' "" Mr. Putin said. ""This appeal, filled with unshakable faith, helped to unite Russia's lands and stamped itself forever on our people's soul and in our historical memory.""  The commemoration, planned for years, provoked some quiet grumbling within the church itself, however, that it was too elaborate. With a war raging next door, the money could have been spent on better things, critics said.  Patriarch Kirill I himself led the 10-mile procession that started the commemoration, beginning from the monastery at Khotkovo, where the saint's parents are buried, to the St. Sergius monastery. The patriarch walked under a white umbrella carried by a younger priest, and during a break in the march closeted himself away from the adoring throng in an air-conditioned mobile home.  ""Faith without deeds is dead,"" said Michael Storojinsky, 53, a religious music producer, explaining why he was walking for five hours under the relentless summer sun. ""I was a Communist in the days when the Communist Party said it was battling religious superstition,"" he said. The party ""placed itself on the pedestal that was meant to be occupied by God.""

87,wall_st.ascii.TE3input.tml,IS e1007 AFTER e1008,Was Tekmira's up after Tekmira's down?,no,"NEW YORK, Aug 4 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed higher on Monday, lifted in a late rally driven by earnings from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and broad gains across most sectors that helped the SP 500 rebound from its largest weekly drop since 2012.  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc gave the SP 500 its biggest boost, helping it snap a two-day losing streak and adding 0.8 of a point to the benchmark index's gain. The company said late Friday that its second-quarter profit soared 41 percent to a record, which helped push its Class B shares up 3.1 percent to end at $129.72.  Despite a broad selloff last week, investors still have a bullish outlook on the markets, said Adam Hewison, president of INO.com in Annapolis, Maryland.  ""If you look at the backdrop of turmoil around the world, whether it's Ukraine, Israel or Palestine, there hasn't been much downward movement in the markets. We had a bad last week in July, but I think that's basically over with, and we're probably going to continue going higher in the equity markets,"" Hewison said.  Gains were partly offset by the SP utilities sector index , which ended the day down 0.59 percent. It was the worst performer of the SP's 10 sectors.  The Dow Jones industrial average rose 75.91 points, or 0.46 percent, to end at 16,569.28. The SP 500 gained 13.84 points, or 0.72 percent, to 1,938.99. The Nasdaq Composite added 31.25 points, or 0.72 percent, to close at 4,383.89.  Monday's advance still left the Dow industrials in negative territory for the year. The blue-chip average ended Monday's session just 7.38 points below its Dec. 31, 2013, close of 16,576.66, which was a record at the time.  The U.S.-listed shares of Tekmira Pharmaceuticals slipped on Nasdaq in a roller-coaster day for the tech-heavy index. Tekmira was viewed as a possible provider of a treatment for an Ebola virus outbreak in Africa, but then CNN reported a drug from privately held Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc had helped at least two patients.  Tekmira's stock was up 18.3 percent on Nasdaq at one point, but finished down 7 percent at $13.26 a share. More than 9.8 million shares traded for the stock's busiest day in its history.  Social media stocks performed well, with the Global X Social Media Index ETF up 1.6 percent. Groupon shares jumped 8.7 percent to $7.02. Facebook shares gained 1.6 percent to $73.51.

6,chomsky_on_gaza.ascii.TE3input.tml,IS e1009 BEFORE e1008,Is the most recent cease-fire before Israeli assaults became far more severe?,no,"Amid all the horrors unfolding in the latest Israeli offensive in Gaza, Israel's goal is simple: quiet-for-quiet, a return to the norm.  For the West Bank, the norm is that Israel continues its illegal construction of settlements and infrastructure so that it can integrate into Israel whatever might be of value, meanwhile consigning Palestinians to unviable cantons and subjecting them to repression and violence.  For Gaza, the norm is a miserable existence under a cruel and destructive siege that Israel administers to permit bare survival but nothing more.  The latest Israeli rampage was set off by the brutal murder of three Israeli boys from a settler community in the occupied West Bank. A month before, two Palestinian boys were shot dead in the West Bank city of Ramallah. That elicited little attention, which is understandable, since it is routine.  ""The institutionalized disregard for Palestinian life in the West helps explain not only why Palestinians resort to violence,"" Middle East analyst Mouin Rabbani reports, ""but also Israel's latest assault on the Gaza Strip.""  In an interview, human rights lawyer Raji Sourani, who has remained in Gaza through years of Israeli brutality and terror, said, ""The most common sentence I heard when people began to talk about cease-fire: Everybody says it's better for all of us to die and not go back to the situation we used to have before this war. We don't want that again. We have no dignity, no pride; we are just soft targets, and we are very cheap. Either this situation really improves or it is better to just die. I am talking about intellectuals, academics, ordinary people: Everybody is saying that.""  In January 2006, Palestinians committed a major crime: They voted the wrong way in a carefully monitored free election, handing control of Parliament to Hamas.  The media constantly intone that Hamas is dedicated to the destruction of Israel. In reality, Hamas leaders have repeatedly made it clear that Hamas would accept a two-state settlement in accord with the international consensus that has been blocked by the U.S. and Israel for 40 years.  In contrast, Israel is dedicated to the destruction of Palestine, apart from some occasional meaningless words, and is implementing that commitment.  The crime of the Palestinians in January 2006 was punished at once. The U.S. and Israel, with Europe shamefully trailing behind, imposed harsh sanctions on the errant population and Israel stepped up its violence.  The U.S. and Israel quickly initiated plans for a military coup to overthrow the elected government. When Hamas had the effrontery to foil the plans, the Israeli assaults and the siege became far more severe.  There should be no need to review again the dismal record since. The relentless siege and savage attacks are punctuated by episodes of ""mowing the lawn,"" to borrow Israel's cheery expression for its periodic exercises in shooting fish in a pond as part of what it calls a ""war of defense.""  Once the lawn is mowed and the desperate population seeks to rebuild somehow from the devastation and the murders, there is a cease-fire agreement. The most recent cease-fire was established after Israel's October 2012 assault, called Operation Pillar of Defense .  Though Israel maintained its siege, Hamas observed the cease-fire, as Israel concedes. Matters changed in April of this year when Fatah and Hamas forged a unity agreement that established a new government of technocrats unaffiliated with either party.  Israel was naturally furious, all the more so when even the Obama administration joined the West in signaling approval. The unity agreement not only undercuts Israel's claim that it cannot negotiate with a divided Palestine but also threatens the long-term goal of dividing Gaza from the West Bank and pursuing its destructive policies in both regions.  Something had to be done, and an occasion arose on June 12, when the three Israeli boys were murdered in the West Bank. Early on, the Netanyahu government knew that they were dead, but pretended otherwise, which provided the opportunity to launch a rampage in the West Bank, targeting Hamas.  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed to have certain knowledge that Hamas was responsible. That too was a lie.  One of Israel's leading authorities on Hamas, Shlomi Eldar, reported almost at once that the killers very likely came from a dissident clan in Hebron that has long been a thorn in the side of Hamas. Eldar added that ""I'm sure they didn't get any green light from the leadership of Hamas, they just thought it was the right time to act.""  The 18-day rampage after the kidnapping, however, succeeded in undermining the feared unity government, and sharply increasing Israeli repression. Israel also conducted dozens of attacks in Gaza, killing five Hamas members on July 7.  Hamas finally reacted with its first rockets in 19 months, providing Israel with the pretext for Operation Protective Edge on July 8.  By July 31, around 1,400 Palestinians had been killed, mostly civilians, including hundreds of women and children. And three Israeli civilians. Large areas of Gaza had been turned into rubble. Four hospitals had been attacked, each another war crime.  Israeli officials laud the humanity of what it calls ""the most moral army in the world,"" which informs residents that their homes will be bombed. The practice is ""sadism, sanctimoniously disguising itself as mercy,"" in the words of Israeli journalist Amira Hass: ""A recorded message demanding hundreds of thousands of people leave their already targeted homes, for another place, equally dangerous, 10 kilometers away.""  In fact, there is no place in the prison of Gaza safe from Israeli sadism, which may even exceed the terrible crimes of Operation Cast Lead in 2008-2009.  The hideous revelations elicited the usual reaction from the most moral president in the world, Barack Obama: great sympathy for Israelis, bitter condemnation of Hamas and calls for moderation on both sides.  When the current attacks are called off, Israel hopes to be free to pursue its criminal policies in the occupied territories without interference, and with the U.S. support it has enjoyed in the past.  Gazans will be free to return to the norm in their Israeli-run prison, while in the West Bank, Palestinians can watch in peace as Israel dismantles what remains of their possessions.  That is the likely outcome if the U.S. maintains its decisive and virtually unilateral support for Israeli crimes and its rejection of the long-standing international consensus on diplomatic settlement. But the future will be quite different if the U.S. withdraws that support.  In that case it would be possible to move toward the ""enduring solution"" in Gaza that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called for, eliciting hysterical condemnation in Israel because the phrase could be interpreted as calling for an end to Israel's siege and regular attacks. And - horror of horrors - the phrase might even be interpreted as calling for implementation of international law in the rest of the occupied territories.  Forty years ago Israel made the fateful decision to choose expansion over security, rejecting a full peace treaty offered by Egypt in return for evacuation from the occupied Egyptian Sinai, where Israel was initiating extensive settlement and development projects. Israel has adhered to that policy ever since.  If the U.S. decided to join the world, the impact would be great. Over and over, Israel has abandoned cherished plans when Washington has so demanded. Such are the relations of power between them.  Furthermore, Israel by now has little recourse, after having adopted policies that turned it from a country that was greatly admired to one that is feared and despised, policies it is pursuing with blind determination today in its march toward moral deterioration and possible ultimate destruction.  Could U.S. policy change? It's not impossible. Public opinion has shifted considerably in recent years, particularly among the young, and it cannot be completely ignored.  For some years there has been a good basis for public demands that Washington observe its own laws and cut off military aid to Israel.

For the West Bank, the norm is that Israel continues its illegal construction of settlements and infrastructure so that it can integrate into Israel whatever might be of value, meanwhile consigning Palestinians to unviable cantons and subjecting them to repression and violence.  For Gaza, the norm is a miserable existence under a cruel and destructive siege that Israel administers to permit bare survival but nothing more.  The latest Israeli rampage was set off by the brutal murder of three Israeli boys from a settler community in the occupied West Bank. A month before, two Palestinian boys were shot dead in the West Bank city of Ramallah. That elicited little attention, which is understandable, since it is routine.  ""The institutionalized disregard for Palestinian life in the West helps explain not only why Palestinians resort to violence,"" Middle East analyst Mouin Rabbani reports, ""but also Israel's latest assault on the Gaza Strip.""  In an interview, human rights lawyer Raji Sourani, who has remained in Gaza through years of Israeli brutality and terror, said, ""The most common sentence I heard when people began to talk about cease-fire: Everybody says it's better for all of us to die and not go back to the situation we used to have before this war. We don't want that again. We have no dignity, no pride; we are just soft targets, and we are very cheap. Either this situation really improves or it is better to just die. I am talking about intellectuals, academics, ordinary people: Everybody is saying that.""  In January 2006, Palestinians committed a major crime: They voted the wrong way in a carefully monitored free election, handing control of Parliament to Hamas.  The media constantly intone that Hamas is dedicated to the destruction of Israel. In reality, Hamas leaders have repeatedly made it clear that Hamas would accept a two-state settlement in accord with the international consensus that has been blocked by the U.S. and Israel for 40 years.  In contrast, Israel is dedicated to the destruction of Palestine, apart from some occasional meaningless words, and is implementing that commitment.  The crime of the Palestinians in January 2006 was punished at once. The U.S. and Israel, with Europe shamefully trailing behind, imposed harsh sanctions on the errant population and Israel stepped up its violence.  The U.S. and Israel quickly initiated plans for a military coup to overthrow the elected government. When Hamas had the effrontery to foil the plans, the Israeli assaults and the siege became far more severe.  There should be no need to review again the dismal record since. The relentless siege and savage attacks are punctuated by episodes of ""mowing the lawn,"" to borrow Israel's cheery expression for its periodic exercises in shooting fish in a pond as part of what it calls a ""war of defense.""  Once the lawn is mowed and the desperate population seeks to rebuild somehow from the devastation and the murders, there is a cease-fire agreement. The most recent cease-fire was established after Israel's October 2012 assault, called Operation Pillar of Defense .  Though Israel maintained its siege, Hamas observed the cease-fire, as Israel concedes. Matters changed in April of this year when Fatah and Hamas forged a unity agreement that established a new government of technocrats unaffiliated with either party.  Israel was naturally furious, all the more so when even the Obama administration joined the West in signaling approval. The unity agreement not only undercuts Israel's claim that it cannot negotiate with a divided Palestine but also threatens the long-term goal of dividing Gaza from the West Bank and pursuing its destructive policies in both regions.  Something had to be done, and an occasion arose on June 12, when the three Israeli boys were murdered in the West Bank. Early on, the Netanyahu government knew that they were dead, but pretended otherwise, which provided the opportunity to launch a rampage in the West Bank, targeting Hamas.  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed to have certain knowledge that Hamas was responsible. That too was a lie.  One of Israel's leading authorities on Hamas, Shlomi Eldar, reported almost at once that the killers very likely came from a dissident clan in Hebron that has long been a thorn in the side of Hamas. Eldar added that ""I'm sure they didn't get any green light from the leadership of Hamas, they just thought it was the right time to act.""  The 18-day rampage after the kidnapping, however, succeeded in undermining the feared unity government, and sharply increasing Israeli repression. Israel also conducted dozens of attacks in Gaza, killing five Hamas members on July 7.  Hamas finally reacted with its first rockets in 19 months, providing Israel with the pretext for Operation Protective Edge on July 8.  By July 31, around 1,400 Palestinians had been killed, mostly civilians, including hundreds of women and children. And three Israeli civilians. Large areas of Gaza had been turned into rubble. Four hospitals had been attacked, each another war crime.  Israeli officials laud the humanity of what it calls ""the most moral army in the world,"" which informs residents that their homes will be bombed. The practice is ""sadism, sanctimoniously disguising itself as mercy,"" in the words of Israeli journalist Amira Hass: ""A recorded message demanding hundreds of thousands of people leave their already targeted homes, for another place, equally dangerous, 10 kilometers away.""  In fact, there is no place in the prison of Gaza safe from Israeli sadism, which may even exceed the terrible crimes of Operation Cast Lead in 2008-2009.  The hideous revelations elicited the usual reaction from the most moral president in the world, Barack Obama: great sympathy for Israelis, bitter condemnation of Hamas and calls for moderation on both sides.  When the current attacks are called off, Israel hopes to be free to pursue its criminal policies in the occupied territories without interference, and with the U.S. support it has enjoyed in the past.  Gazans will be free to return to the norm in their Israeli-run prison, while in the West Bank, Palestinians can watch in peace as Israel dismantles what remains of their possessions.

19,james_brady_dies.ascii.TE3input.tml,IS e1003 BEFORE e1001,Did the former White House press secretary become an unwavering gun-control advocate before he was shot?,no,"James Brady, a former White House press secretary who was shot in the head during the 1981 assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan and who went on to become an unwavering gun-control advocate, has died at age 73, his family said Monday.  Mr. Brady was injured on March 30, 1981, when a mentally troubled man, John Hinckley Jr. , opened fire at the Washington Hilton Hotel seeking to impress actress Jodie Foster. Mr. Brady, 40 years old at the time, was one of four men shot, including the president, a Secret Service officer and a District of Columbia police officer. Mr. Brady's injuries proved the longest-lasting and left him in a wheelchair for much of the rest of his life.  For the remainder of the Reagan administration, Mr. Brady retained his press-secretary title while deputies took over daily operations. Mr. Brady would appear at the White House about once a week, allowing him to provide strategic advice to Larry Speakes, who took over daily press-secretary duties, and maintain social ties to the administration.  In 1987, Mr. Brady's wife, Sarah, initiated an effort to require purchasers of handguns to undergo criminal background checks before taking possession of a gun. Mr. Hinckley wasn't screened before buying his gun from a licensed dealer and used a false address on a required federal firearms-purchase form.  Mr. Brady first spoke out in favor of what became known as the Brady bill in November 1989, saying he was disgusted by Congress's inaction on the issue when faced with gun-violence statistics. ""Well, this statistic has decided to break his silence,"" he told the Senate Judiciary Committee.  He described the physical difficulties he had faced since the shooting, requiring assistance to get out of bed, to eat, to get dressed. ""I even need help to go to the bathroom,"" he said.  The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act was signed into law in 1993 by President Bill Clinton, after several years of debate and opposition from the National Rifle Association.  ""He would patrol the halls of Congress, his wife pushing his wheelchair, persuading members of Congress that this was the right thing to do,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y), a leading sponsor of the Brady bill.  ""I was deeply saddened to learn of Jim Brady's passing today,"" former first lady Nancy Reagan said in a written statement. ""Thinking of him brings back so many memories-happy and sad-of a time in all of our lives when we learned what it means to 'play the hand we're dealt.' "" She added, ""I still remember vividly that day in March 1981, when Sarah and I sat together in a tiny room near the emergency room at George Washington University Hospital, trying to comfort each other while we both were gripped with unspeakable fear.""  In 1997, Mr. Clinton awarded Mr. Brady the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. In 2000, the White House press briefing room was renamed in his honor.  In recent months, Mr. Brady's health began a steep decline, with bouts of pneumonia and other ailments, said Gail Hoffman, a family spokeswoman. The cause of death wasn't yet clear.  ""Life was very difficult for him-he was in a lot of pain every day,"" said Ms. Hoffman, who served as the legislative director of Handgun Control Inc., the Bradys' organization fighting to pass the gun-control legislation. The group was later renamed the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.  Mr. Brady, who served as press secretary for the first two months of the Reagan administration, is remembered by colleagues and friends as a skilled and evenhanded arbiter between the press and the administration.  ""He really set-in those two short months-the gold standard for being press secretary,"" said Ken Duberstein, a former Reagan chief of staff who at the time was the president's congressional liaison.

Mr. Brady was injured on March 30, 1981, when a mentally troubled man, John Hinckley Jr. , opened fire at the Washington Hilton Hotel seeking to impress actress Jodie Foster. Mr. Brady, 40 years old at the time, was one of four men shot, including the president, a Secret Service officer and a District of Columbia police officer.

For the remainder of the Reagan administration, Mr. Brady retained his press-secretary title while deputies took over daily operations. Mr. Brady would appear at the White House about once a week, allowing him to provide strategic advice to Larry Speakes, who took over daily press-secretary duties, and maintain social ties to the administration.  In 1987, Mr. Brady's wife, Sarah, initiated an effort to require purchasers of handguns to undergo criminal background checks before taking possession of a gun. Mr. Hinckley wasn't screened before buying his gun from a licensed dealer and used a false address on a required federal firearms-purchase form.  Mr. Brady first spoke out in favor of what became known as the Brady bill in November 1989, saying he was disgusted by Congress's inaction on the issue when faced with gun-violence statistics. ""Well, this statistic has decided to break his silence,"" he told the Senate Judiciary Committee.  He described the physical difficulties he had faced since the shooting, requiring assistance to get out of bed, to eat, to get dressed. ""I even need help to go to the bathroom,"" he said.  The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act was signed into law in 1993 by President Bill Clinton, after several years of debate and opposition from the National Rifle Association.

40,marijuana.ascii.TE3input.tml,IS e1001 BEFORE e1002,Was the federal law passed before the cannabis plant was widely grown?,no,"The federal law that makes possession of marijuana a crime has its origins in legislation that was passed in an atmosphere of hysteria during the 1930s and that was firmly rooted in prejudices against Mexican immigrants and African-Americans, who were associated with marijuana use at the time. This racially freighted history lives on in current federal policy, which is so driven by myth and propaganda that it is almost impervious to reason.  The cannabis plant, also known as hemp, was widely grown in the United States for use in fabric during the mid-19th century. The practice of smoking it appeared in Texas border towns around 1900, brought by Mexican immigrants who cultivated cannabis as an intoxicant and for medicinal purposes as they had done at home.  Within 15 years or so, it was plentiful along the Texas border and was advertised openly at grocery markets and drugstores, some of which shipped small packets by mail to customers in other states.  The law enforcement view of marijuana was indelibly shaped by the fact that it was initially connected to brown people from Mexico and subsequently with black and poor communities in this country. Police in Texas border towns demonized the plant in racial terms as the drug of ""immoral"" populations who were promptly labeled ""fiends.""  As the legal scholars Richard Bonnie and Charles Whitebread explain in their authoritative history, ""The Marihuana Conviction,"" the drug's popularity among minorities and other groups practically ensured that it would be classified as a ""narcotic,"" attributed with addictive qualities it did not have, and set alongside far more dangerous drugs like heroin and morphine.  By the early 1930s, more than 30 states had prohibited the use of marijuana for nonmedical purposes. The federal push was yet to come.  The stage for federal suppression of marijuana was set in New Orleans, where a prominent doctor blamed ""muggle-heads"" - as pot smokers were called - for an outbreak of robberies. The city was awash in sensationalistic newspaper articles that depicted pushers hovering by the schoolhouse door turning children into ""addicts."" These stories popularized spurious notions about the drug that lingered for decades. Law enforcement officials, too, trafficked in the ""assassin"" theory, under in which killers were said to have smoked cannabis to ready themselves for murder and mayhem.  In 1930, Congress consolidated the drug control effort in the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, led by the endlessly resourceful commissioner, Harry Jacob Anslinger, who became the architect of national prohibition. His case rested on two fantastical assertions: that the drug caused insanity; that it pushed people toward horrendous acts of criminality. Others at the time argued that it was fiercely addictive.  He may not have actually believed his propaganda, but he fed it by giving lurid stories to the press as a way of making a case for federal intervention. This narrative had a great effect at Congressional hearings that led to the enactment of The Marijuana Tax Act of 1937, which tried to eradicate the use and sale of the drug through heavy taxation.  Mr. Bonnie and Mr. Whitebread report that the witness list for those hearings contained not a single person who had done significant research into the effects of cannabis. Mr. Anslinger testified that even a single marijuana cigarette could induce a ""homicidal mania,"" prompting people to want to kill those they loved. The bill passed handily; President Franklin Roosevelt signed it into law.  It was not until 1951, when Congress again took up the issue, that a reputable researcher was called to testify. Dr. Harris Isbell, director of research at the Public Health Service Hospital in Lexington, Ky., disputed the insanity, crime and addiction theories, telling Congress that ""smoking marijuana has no unpleasant aftereffects, no dependence is developed on the drug, and the practice can easily be stopped at any time.""

But it clings to a policy that has its origins in racism and xenophobia and whose principal effect has been to ruin the lives of generations of people.  Copyright New York Times."

Putin seeks to harness as his own.  The official reason for the trek to the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius, the seat of the Russian Orthodox faith and the country's original monastery, was to commemorate the 700th birthday of its founder and namesake.  But amid that tide of pilgrims - official estimates hovered around 30,000 - swirled diverse political and religious currents related to Mr. Putin's effort to cast himself as the defender of traditional values, a campaign that has become more pronounced since Russia's involvement with Ukraine.  The birthday celebrations in Sergiyev Posad emphasized St. Sergius's role in shaping a unified Russia, a narrative that dovetails with the nationalism and conservative morals that Mr. Putin espouses.  Some historians and church figures are crying foul, however, over what they say are the Kremlin's efforts to reshape the saint's legacy to enhance political goals, fostering what one critic called ""an official cult.""  ""They are creating a myth around St. Sergius, making him out to be an obedient servant of the Russian state, which he was not,"" said Irina Karatsuba, a historian who often aligns herself with unpopular causes. ""He is one of the important embodiments of what was and is the best in Russia. But the way they are trying to link him to the Russian state is nonsense; it's political manipulation.""  The pilgrimage illustrates one way Mr. Putin is trying to use Russian Orthodoxy as a tie that binds Russians together, analysts said, fashioning a fresh ideology for his continued rule after 14 years as either president or prime minister. His participation in the St. Sergius celebration last month was broadcast live nationally.  Church officials said they wanted St. Sergius to serve as an example of spiritual hope for Russians in their daily lives.  The Russian Orthodox Church was resurrected after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, ending 70 years of often brutal Communist repression. The church seems only too happy to hitch its halting rebirth to Mr. Putin's fortunes, hoping to attract more adherents. Although 80 percent of the 140 million Russians identify themselves as Russian Orthodox culturally, the number who actually attend church is tiny. The church says it is nearly 10 percent, but experts say it has long hovered around 3 percent.  Another reason for St. Sergius's elevation is the current crisis in Ukraine.  The birth of the Russian Orthodox faith dates back to Vladimir the Great, grand prince of Kiev, and the mass baptisms performed at his behest there in 988, bringing Christianity to what then became Holy Rus.  But now that Russia and Ukraine are locked in a proxy war, the government and the church realize that the physical link to an important religious symbol is being severed, noted Geraldine Fagan, author of ""Believing in Russia - Religious Policy After Communism.""  Because those roots - not to mention the relics of St. Vladimir himself - are in the territory of an estranged neighbor, Russia appears to be casting St. Sergius as his replacement, Ms. Fagan said.  In the late 14th century, aside from founding the first monastery, St. Sergius of Radonezh persuaded the Russian princes to stop their murderous, internecine fighting and concentrate on throwing off the Mongol yoke.  ""St. Sergius was the beginning not just of Russian monasticism or the Russian spiritual tradition,"" said Vladimir Legoyda, the head of the information department for the Holy Synod. ""In many ways he is the source of Russia itself.""  The saint has long been revered as a humble figure, content to spend his days in prayer and dressing like a beggar. He turned down the job of leading the church, but was given the unique title of abbot for all Russia.  ""He is a great personality in Russian history,"" said Margarita Popova, a 48-year-old English teacher who traveled 17 hours by bus with her teenage son from their home near Volgograd for the anniversary. ""Russia before Sergei Radonezh and Russia after was perhaps two different Russias.""  Ordinary people, Ms. Popova said, do not have the time to pray for themselves, for Russia and for the world constantly. The monks who do so are following a tradition started in the Russian Orthodox Church by St. Sergius. He is often identified as the original staretz, a Russian word that means a monastic spiritual leader, one who has achieved tangible experience in the future kingdom of God.  Beyond spiritual matters, the crowd at the birthday commemoration at the monastery here, 45 miles north of Moscow, was unquestionably in the Putin camp. Many compared him to a czar, and meant it as a compliment.  ""He has just not been anointed,"" said Vladimir Bubelev, 60, an officer in the naval reserves wearing a brass pin showing the profile of Nicholas II, the last czar, on his lapel.  ""But his powers are greater than those of Nicholas II,"" Mr. Bubelev said. ""On many questions he acts like a monarch - he makes correct, willful decisions. This is very good. Plus he is a believer!""  As it happens, the birthday of St. Sergius and the anniversary of the death of Nicholas II fall within a couple of days of each other in July. The church made Nicholas II and his immediate family saints in 2000. The czar's 1917 overthrow was for many Orthodox faithful the last time that a man anointed by God governed Russia.  When the czars ruled, Mr. Bubelev persisted, Russia evoked both nobility and morality. The Romanovs deeply revered both St. Sergius and a later, 19th-century monk, St. Seraphim of Sarov, also worshiped by the Russian Orthodox.  ""They helped the czars rule Russia in the right way - they made Russia rich,"" Mr. Bubelev said. The czars ""went to their relics and asked for God's help, and they succeeded. Thank God Mr. Putin is asking for their help now.""  But Ms. Karatsuba, the historian, pointed out that the Romanov rulers also tried to elevate the concept of Holy Rus as a national ideal in their campaign to stall political reform in the 19th century. That turned out badly for them in 1917, she noted.  Still, the Slavic nationalism prevalent among the faithful makes them a natural base of support for Mr. Putin's policy that all ethnic Russians are worthy of protection wherever they are. That has been his stated reason for championing the cause of anti-Kiev insurgents in southeastern Ukraine.  ""We are all one people, we are all part of Holy Rus,"" said Dmitry Markov, 28, a buyer for a cellphone company who attended the St. Sergius commemoration. ""Any person, regardless of where he lives, if he is Russian in spirit, he must be defended by his president, by his country, because he is an indivisible part of the nation.""  Mr. Putin, who attended the anniversary celebration less than 24 hours after a civilian plane disaster in Ukraine that many blamed on Moscow, addressed the faithful for only about five minutes. He lauded the ""patriotic, national and moral resurgence"" inspired by the monk, including his campaign to build monasteries as both spiritual centers and real fortresses to protect Russia.  ""His wise and solid words as a mentor and guide were a spiritual pillar and support during a difficult time of foreign invasion and internal discord,"" Mr. Putin said.  ""It was then that he spoke his prophetic words: 'Our salvation lies in love and unity,' "" Mr. Putin said. ""This appeal, filled with unshakable faith, helped to unite Russia's lands and stamped itself forever on our people's soul and in our historical memory.""  The commemoration, planned for years, provoked some quiet grumbling within the church itself, however, that it was too elaborate. With a war raging next door, the money could have been spent on better things, critics said.  Patriarch Kirill I himself led the 10-mile procession that started the commemoration, beginning from the monastery at Khotkovo, where the saint's parents are buried, to the St. Sergius monastery. The patriarch walked under a white umbrella carried by a younger priest, and during a break in the march closeted himself away from the adoring throng in an air-conditioned mobile home.  ""Faith without deeds is dead,"" said Michael Storojinsky, 53, a religious music producer, explaining why he was walking for five hours under the relentless summer sun. ""I was a Communist in the days when the Communist Party said it was battling religious superstition,"" he said. The party ""placed itself on the pedestal that was meant to be occupied by God.""

Church officials said they wanted St. Sergius to serve as an example of spiritual hope for Russians in their daily lives.

The birth of the Russian Orthodox faith dates back to Vladimir the Great, grand prince of Kiev, and the mass baptisms performed at his behest there in 988, bringing Christianity to what then became Holy Rus.

83,wall_st.ascii.TE3input.tml,IS e1004 BEFORE e1001,Did the company said its profit soared before stocks close?,yes,"NEW YORK, Aug 4 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed higher on Monday, lifted in a late rally driven by earnings from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and broad gains across most sectors that helped the SP 500 rebound from its largest weekly drop since 2012.  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc gave the SP 500 its biggest boost, helping it snap a two-day losing streak and adding 0.8 of a point to the benchmark index's gain. The company said late Friday that its second-quarter profit soared 41 percent to a record, which helped push its Class B shares up 3.1 percent to end at $129.72.  Despite a broad selloff last week, investors still have a bullish outlook on the markets, said Adam Hewison, president of INO.com in Annapolis, Maryland.  ""If you look at the backdrop of turmoil around the world, whether it's Ukraine, Israel or Palestine, there hasn't been much downward movement in the markets. We had a bad last week in July, but I think that's basically over with, and we're probably going to continue going higher in the equity markets,"" Hewison said.  Gains were partly offset by the SP utilities sector index , which ended the day down 0.59 percent. It was the worst performer of the SP's 10 sectors.  The Dow Jones industrial average rose 75.91 points, or 0.46 percent, to end at 16,569.28. The SP 500 gained 13.84 points, or 0.72 percent, to 1,938.99. The Nasdaq Composite added 31.25 points, or 0.72 percent, to close at 4,383.89.  Monday's advance still left the Dow industrials in negative territory for the year. The blue-chip average ended Monday's session just 7.38 points below its Dec. 31, 2013, close of 16,576.66, which was a record at the time.  The U.S.-listed shares of Tekmira Pharmaceuticals slipped on Nasdaq in a roller-coaster day for the tech-heavy index. Tekmira was viewed as a possible provider of a treatment for an Ebola virus outbreak in Africa, but then CNN reported a drug from privately held Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc had helped at least two patients.  Tekmira's stock was up 18.3 percent on Nasdaq at one point, but finished down 7 percent at $13.26 a share. More than 9.8 million shares traded for the stock's busiest day in its history.  Social media stocks performed well, with the Global X Social Media Index ETF up 1.6 percent. Groupon shares jumped 8.7 percent to $7.02. Facebook shares gained 1.6 percent to $73.51.  Over the next few weeks, the stock market is likely to be quiet with earnings season winding down and scores of traders leaving for vacation.
