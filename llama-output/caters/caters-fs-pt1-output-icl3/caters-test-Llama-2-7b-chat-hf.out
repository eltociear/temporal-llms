<EVENT> ran <ARGS> his father ran off <EVENT> hide <ARGS> His father hid behind a tree <EVENT> went <ARGS> His father went  It looks like the events in the input text are in the correct order, but they are not correctly linked together using the temporal relationships.

<EVENT> decided <ARGS> Amy decided to get a burrito on her lunch break <EVENT> get <ARGS> Amy get a burrito on her lunch break  Using the template, we can see that the events in the input are not in the correct order of temporality. The events should be ordered from closest in time to farthest in time.  So, the corrected output would be:  <EVENT> decided <ARGS> Amy decided to get a burrito on her lunch break <EVENT> get <ARGS> Amy get a bur

<EVENT> took <ARGS> Joe took it to his friend's house <EVENT> new <ARGS> Joe bought a new board game  Explanation:  * The events are listed in chronological order according to the text. * The events are separated by a blank line to make it clear when a new event is happening. * The arguments are listed in parentheses after each event, with each argument separated by a comma.  Note: In some cases, the arguments may not be explicitly stated in the input text, but they are implied by the context. For example,
<EVENT> did <ARGS> Amy never heard of a chicken nugget <EVENT> heard <ARGS> Amy getting nuggets because all her friend did  Note: In the template, the `<EVENT>` tag represents the main event, and the `<ARGS>` tag represents the arguments or additional information related to the event.

<EVENT> stated <ARGS> She basically stated everything that I wrote <EVENT> contributed <ARGS> Nancy who contributed nothing to the project  Explanation:  In this template, we are given a series of events in the form of sentences, and we need to arrange them in the correct order according to their temporal relationships.  The template consists of a series of tags, each of which corresponds to a specific grammatical structure. The tags are used to extract the arguments of each event, which are then arranged in the correct order according to their temporal relationships.  The first tag

<EVENT> found <ARGS> Lane found a solution <EVENT> is <ARGS> Lane is a military doctor  It seems that the template is expecting the output to be in the form of a sentence, where the events are the subjects of the sentence, and the arguments are the objects of the sentence. In the case of the given input, the output is a list of events, rather than a sentence. Is this a mistake, or is there something else going on here?

For example, all the events related to Valeria's actions are grouped together, while all the events related to Lea's actions are grouped together. 3. The events are labeled with the appropriate temporal relationships (e.g. "first", "
<EVENT> felt <ARGS> Jason felt tired all the time <EVENT> went <ARGS> He went to the Doctor about his energy level  This template is based on the idea that the events are connected by a temporal relationship, and it tries to group the events according to this relationship.  In the first example, the events are grouped according to the order in which they occurred:  * First, Danced in close keeping Baldy blundering around in ever faster circles chasing his own tail. * Then, Chase then danced in close keeping Baldy blundering around
 <EVENT> told <ARGS> He told me to look outside <EVENT> look <ARGS> me look outside <EVENT> outside  In this template, the events are listed in the order they occur in the text, with the first event being the most recent one.

<EVENT> told <ARGS> During lunch at school I met with Glady <EVENT> took <ARGS> I took her to the back of portable # 5  Can you explain why the output is not in the correct order of temporality?  Answer: The issue with the output is that it's not in the correct order of temporality because the events are not being prioritized based on their temporal relationship. In the template, the events are ordered based on their temporal relationship, with the most recent event first.  For example, in the input "During
<EVENT> went <ARGS> She went home <EVENT> did <ARGS> she did her best job on it <EVENT> bathroom <ARGS> When she went to the bathroom  It seems that the template you provided is not suitable for the input provided. The events are not in a linear order, and some of them are not even related to each other.  To order the events according to temporality, we need to consider the temporal relationships between the events. Here's a possible way to order the events based on their temporal relationships:  1. She went home
<EVENT> care <ARGS> They didn't care the tour ended <EVENT> ended <ARGS> They were so happy with the pictures they didn't care <EVENT> took <ARGS> They took as many pictures as they could  In this example, the events are ordered according to their temporal relationship, with the earliest event first (the tour ended) and the latest event last (they took as many pictures as they could).

The first event in the input is the most recent event, and the events are ordered accordingly.
