  # Description  As described in the article, the order of events can be described as a graph. In the example below, you can see that it is a directed acyclic graph. Each line is an event, and the order is from left to right.  ![](./doc/graph_example.png)  The graph is acyclic because there are no cycles in the graph. If there were cycles, there would be no order.  # How to run  1. Set up a Conda environment.      ```bash     conda env create -f con
